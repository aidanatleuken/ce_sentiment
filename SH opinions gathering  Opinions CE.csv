1-1,"How can a circular economy be implemented in construction industries? 
If you are talking about construction Industries it’s very waste. Construction industry is growing very fastly here I am sharing few important point with you.

While increasing the sustainability of concrete is understandably a top priority for the construction industry, it is not the only one. There has also been much discussion about the many millions of tons of waste produced by the industry worldwide. It's a growing issue that shows no signs of abating. And it has prompted industry leaders to talk more about circular economy solutions.

The best place to begin is at the beginning.

How you approach your construction design from the very start will dictate how well your project will meet circular economy standards.

While compelling, the typical starting point will not suffice.

In today's construction climate, the typical approach is to make a structure as durable as possible using sustainable products.",neutral,Quora,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-circular-economy-be-implemented-in-construction-industries

Inadequate understanding of circular economy solutions

Inconsistent understanding of what circular economy solutions are Obstacles from existing codes and regulations

Concerns about the durability and resilience of reclaimed materials

Concerns about time and money

Inability to change a project's approach due to a lack of leverage

Building components are not standardized or transportable.

Comparison of the circular economy to other sustainable strategies is difficult.

Consider using a ""Design for Disassembly"" strategy.",negative,Quora,
1-3,"A ""design for disassembly"" (DfD) approach is one of the best ways to ensure waste reduction does not fall by the wayside of your construction. It is a concept that emphasizes designing and planning a building with deconstruction in mind from the start so that its materials can be reused for future construction.

Choose high-quality, long-lasting materials that can withstand disassembly.
If they aren't going to be reused, make sure they can be recycled.
Inquire about take-back programs and cradle-to-cradle certification with your suppliers.
Use salvaged materials for structural and finishing purposes.
Save information on project building materials for future use.
Glues and sealants are preferable to screwed or nailed bolted connections.
Look for simpler-looking fasteners and connection points.
Choose fasteners that can be easily disassembled with standard tools.
Ensure that fasteners are easily accessible.
Choosing the right materials is an important part of that

Cement producers can help by replacing their use of traditional fossil fuels.

Concrete would be unrecognizable without its primary constituent: cement. However, the production of that material can be quite carbon-intensive. In fact, doing so contributes to approximately 8% of total global carbon emissions.

There are also industrial by-products that can be used to improve concrete mixes.

While emissions from cement production can be reduced, they cannot be eliminated entirely. Another way to reduce carbon emissions and waste is to partially replace cement with other materials.

2-1,"Is the circular economy an intelligent bet for the future?
It is the only way to achieve our future prosperity. It is the best option we have to conquer a desirable future, since there is no other way out, unless we duplicate the surface of the planet Earth. A circular economy is an alternative economy to the traditional linear economy that we know today and that consists of producing, using and disposing of the goods or products that we manufacture, so that the life cycle is short, and that we later turn into waste or garbage. which we have to get rid of.
",positive,Quora,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-circular-economy-an-intelligent-bet-for-the-future
2-2,"On the contrary, the Circular Economy is an economy that maintains the utility of resources for as long as possible, extracts the maximum value from resources while they are in use, as well as recovering and regenerating the products and materials that are used, in the end of its life cycle.

The Circular Economy is absolutely necessary because the world in which we live has finite resources. Metals, gas and oil are not unlimited resources, unlike our appetite for them. In addition, our current development model involves a total linearity throughout the process that starts from the extraction of raw materials, passes through the manufacture of consumer goods, the use of the products it produces and concludes with the generation of waste for its subsequent disposal as garbage. This economy is by definition unsustainable.
",positive,Quora,
2-3,"On the contrary, a circular economy is an alternative model that is anticipated and designed so that the products we manufacture, or the materials we consume, can be reused, recycled or reduced. It creates a kind of biological and ""nutrients"" that allow us to continuously reuse the goods or products of the same quality, drastically reducing our dependence on obtaining new materials.",positive,Quora,
2-4,"In addition, we must consider that the circular economy is a practical solution to the crisis of emerging resources of the planet. The reserves of key resources such as metals and minerals known as rare earths are decreasing, while the costs of exploration and extraction of these mineral resources are increasing. As the current model of the linear economy, consisting of ""produce, use and dispose"" , the final result is a massive production of waste or waste that only causes problems of elimination, as well as a progressive exhaustion of resources.",positive,Quora,
2-5,"In effect, 90% of the raw materials used in the manufacture of a product become garbage, even before the product leaves the factory. In the same way, 80% of manufactured products become garbage within the first six months of its useful life. These facts, together with the growing tensions that arise around geopolitics and supply risks, are contributing to the fact that the prices of these products are often volatile. The Circular Economy could help to stabilize some of these issues and, in particular, to dissociate economic growth from the consumption of resources.",positive,Quora,
2-6,"The Circular Economy is much more than a product recycling

While the substitution of secondary materials for primary materials can offer a partial solution to the problem of depletion of resources, recycling offers limited appeal because its processes are energy intensive and, in general, degrade materials, so that This leads to the continuous high demand for virgin materials. That's what happens with paper or recycling paper.

The circular economy goes beyond recycling, since it is based on an industrial system of restoration oriented towards the design of waste. For this reason, the Circular Economy demands a greater energy contribution in the processes of ""repair, reuse and re-manufacturing"". The objective of the design of the products is not only that the design allows a better recovery, at the end of the life of the product, but that it reduces, to a minimum, the consumption of energy necessary for its recovery.

3-1,"Sustainability: What does 'circular economy' mean?
Essentially it's the more sustainable alternative to our current ""linear"" economy system.

What most industries do right now is: Take, Make and Dispose. Extract resources, process them into products, dispose off after use as waste. This is a linear system, the waste after use ultimately goes back to the earth and is, more often than not, toxic, unusable or takes long to biodegrade.

In the long run, this is definitely not a sustainable approach, unless we start creating new things from the waste that is produced.

3-2,"In a circular economy model, we learn from the Earth's natural systems. Whatever nature produces, goes back to nature and this cycle indefinitely repeats (a very simple example would be, a plant grows from the soil, lives and uses water/resources, dies and decomposes back into soil providing nutrients for other plants). Somebody's waste is someone else's food. Similarly, circular economy takes inspiration from natural processes so as to design methods, products or business models that are similar to this regenerative process.",positive,Quora,

How is this done -- by making sure the ""technological"" and ""biological"" factors of the entire process are a part of a bigger material cycle designed for reusability or repurposing. Alter your product or business model accordingly to provide for maintenance or end-of-product-life services; use materials that can last longer or be used again with minimal energy; use renewable energy sources at each step of the process; understand how one part of the process will affect other parts (systems thinking); . A simple image to that can help explain this cycle:




So the circular model (though not very easy to achieve) is ultimately less wasteful, uses resources more efficiently and more industries should adopt the process for long-term overall sustainable development.

4-1,"as a Chinese person, I will give you two circular economy models in China, one has been used for hundreds of years, and the other has emerged in the 21st century.

Mulberry Fish Pond

The Mulberry Fish Pond fishpond deepens the water net depression into a pond, and the dredged mud is piled up on the four sides of the pond to form a high base. Mulberries are planted on the base, fish are raised in the pond, mulberry leaves are used to raise silkworms, and silkworm excrement is used to feed fish, while the sludge in the fishpond can be used to fertilize the mulberry. Through such recycling, the two final products of silk and fresh fish are obtained, realizing the economic benefits of ""both benefits, ten times the profits of ordinary crops"". The production cycle of mulberry, silkworm and fish begins with mulberry planting and ends with sericulture, forming a close relationship between mulberry, silkworm and fish. The quality of any production link in the system will also affect other production links.
",positive,Quora,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-circular-economy-model
4-2,"There is a Chinese agricultural proverb that describes this matter as follows: mulberry trees grow well - silkworm can grow strong - fish can grow well - the sludge in the pond has good fertility - mulberry trees grow well, in addition to getting stronger pond dams, more cocoons and more fish. （“桑茂、蚕壮、鱼肥大，塘肥、基好、蚕茧多”）Mulberries can also provide vitamins as fruit.

This method has been used in China for more than 2500 years. Huzhou Sangji Fish Pond System has nearly 60000 mu of mulberry land and 150000 mu of fish pond, which is the most concentrated, largest and most complete area in China's Sangji Fish Pond, and is rated by UNESCO as ""rare beauty in the world, a model of virtuous cycle"".

But this may not make sense for most countries except China, because the fish here are freshwater fish, and there are many fish bones in the fish body. Except for Chinese people, there are not many countries like to eat freshwater fish. This is why there are a large number of inland rivers invaded by Asian carp in the United States, but there are few ways to deal with them.

There is also a variety: mulberry - paddy field - fish pond. This model uses paddy fields planted with rice as shallow fish ponds to raise fish. The fish live by eating the fallen leaves, fallen flowers of rice and silkworm excrement. Fish can also eat some pests and pest eggs in paddy fields. In this mode, rice is the main product, and fish and cocoons are by-products. This kind of fish is very delicious.

In the 21st century, with the rapid development of green energy in China, a new model of circular economy has emerged, that is, solar power plant - sheep husbandry.

Solar power plants use a large amount of semi-desert land in northern China. Because the solar panels shield the sun and reduce the evaporation rate of the ground, the grass in the power station grows better. The grass even grows to the extent that it needs to be weeded, otherwise it will threaten the solar panels, so the solar power plants allow herders to herd sheep in the solar power plants. In this way, sheep have grass to eat, sheep dung improves the fertility of the land, the growth of grass is better, the desertification momentum is stopped, and the solar power station has also completed the weeding work.

5-1,"A new model based on a circular system with no waste leakage needs to take into account the entire value chain. Materials must be chosen that can always be reused or recycled. Design and manufacturing must allow for a standardised and efficient collection and recycling process. The product must meet the consumer's needs, otherwise the consumer will choose another product. Disposal and collection in order to capture the product at the end of its life must be convenient for the consumer. Processing the product back into a reusable resource must be cost effective.

At the core of this change, we need to view product and packaging waste as a commodity. Mainstream penetration of a circular economy model will require a new design approach, industry wide collaboration and a consumer mindset change. Momentum could be gained by initially implementing this model with a few companies that align with sustainable values, have the willpower to change and have a consumer base that believes in these values.

At the end of the toys life, it could be crushed down and processed back into a printable filament (a company called ReDeTec has developed a product called the ProtoCycler for this purpose).

They will also directly benefit consumers by introducing standards that improve waste management and the generation of value from waste. All this will reduce the cost of product management, at the end of its life cycle and will promote a better product design that, in turn, will allow the products to be more durable and efficient.

Finally the time came for the contract to be renewed or rebid, and the recycling contractor and the city quibbled for months over terms of renewal and reached an impasse.

20-1," The main goals of circularity are to:

Slow, minimize, and narrow a product’s energy and material loops by maximizing the use and reuse of natural capital.

Eliminate waste (material and energy) by adopting innovative materials, products, business models, and systems of operation.

Eliminate toxic materials and non-renewable energy from manufacturing and use and replace them with biodegradable materials and renewable energy sources.

In a circular economy, adequately monetizing a product’s negative impact on the environment, such as landfill loading or contribution to climate change, will make it more expensive; hence, the market drives the reduction of negative impacts as it seeks to lower prices. Ideally, items with a lower impact will be less expensive.

By creating a business model with long-lasting products and streamlined maintenance, repair, reuse, and remanufacturing of those products, a business reduces their social and environmental impacts. In addition to minimizing waste, a business is able to maximize the value of the time, energy and materials in which they have already invested.

20-2,"Establishing a circular economy is no small feat but it is a crucial ‘next step’ toward society’s imperative to establish systems with a restorative and regenerative impact on the planet.

The term “circularity” describes the industrial ecosystem we aspire to where:

use of raw materials as manufacturing input are minimized and instead, reclaimed materials are favored;

renting a product - in lieu of ownership - obliges the return of that product to the manufacturer when it fails or becomes obsolete where it is remanufactured or disassembled and all its components are reclaimed; and,

wastes from manufacturing or use are designed out of the product.

Walter R. Stahel, who is considered the father of industrial sustainability, dubbed this model “Cradle-to-Cradle” implying that discarded materials will live many lives as they are intentionally recycled, remanufactured, and reused.

The term “linearity” describes most of our contemporary industrial ecosystems where:

virgin materials are used to manufacture a product;

that product is purchased by a user and used until it is discarded when it fails or becomes obsolete; and,

wastes generated during the manufacture and use of that product are discarded.
",positive,Quora,
20-3,"Often this ecosystem is described as “Cradle-to-Grave,” implying the end of life for all that is discarded. In a linear economy, the ecological benefits of a product - or conversely, its ecological toll - are rarely factored into its market price. This scenario, and these terms, describe “business as usual” today for much of the world.

In a fully circular economy, the reuse of a manufactured product is considered in the earliest design phases of its creation. This allows both small- and large-scale products to be repurposed for another use quickly and efficiently once their initial use is fulfilled.

As businesses are starting to consider and implement more sustainable and socially responsible methods of operation, viable and cost-effective models of circularity are beginning to manifest. You might be wondering how the metals industry, and your organization in particular, can adopt these exciting and opportunity-filled developments, but you also might be feeling overwhelmed by the amount of circular economy-related information flooding in.

Scientists have been warning us about the risks of excessive resource usage for many years. We continue to use nonrenewable resources, such as oil and metal ores, as though there is a limitless supply of them now more than ever. This method cannot be continued. Reusing materials and repairing old products (instead of tossing them away) are commonplace in a circular economy. We will consume fewer nonrenewable resources as a result of this. Zero waste, or the idea that nothing is wasted, is the hallmark of a circular economy. In essence, it's a more wise use of the resources we already have.

A circular economy benefits consumers in a variety of ways in addition to the environment. Reusing materials prevents practises like planned obsolescence, so your products will last longer as a result. Since it promotes behaviours like purchasing secondhand goods, leasing or renting instead of owning, and other more economical activities, it also promises a rise in discretionary income. The creation of jobs is another significant benefit for consumers. It will take the emergence of numerous new industry types to establish a circular economy. This implies that a large number of new jobs will be accessible. Many environmental initiatives may eliminate chances for certain jobs, such as coal mining or other occupations centred upon non renewable resources.

The circular economy model has several advantages that businesses can also recognise. As noted above, there are more employment prospects as well as business opportunities (such as refurbishing old items, collecting used resources like clothing or electronics, and so on). Because we reuse the resources we already have rather than relying on finite resources, existing businesses can also benefit from a more reliable supply of resources. This could lower the cost of materials, enabling businesses to operate more effectively. Additionally, the technique might increase patron loyalty.

Till recent years, unlimited growth was the only definition available. GDP became the inaccurate indicator for a country's wealth because the welfare of the people is not taken into consideration. For example, the widening gap between the rich and the poor is a big problem, despite a good GDP performance. Sure, a lot of people are talking about Bezo's travel in the air, but not enough people talking about the homelessness on the ground.

Furthermore, when we look at the current linear economy, it is a model that expends resources to create economic growth. But our resources are finite, and the linear economy is unable to provide a solution when those resources run out.

Therefore, the circular economy attempts to tackle these two issues by addressing the welfare of a people and decoupling economic growth from resources.

From an economist perspective that favors limited government intervention, the implementation of circular economy principles should not be enforced through government regulations or mandates. Rather, it should be a voluntary initiative undertaken by private businesses and entrepreneurs who see the benefits of reducing waste and increasing efficiency.

In this view, the market and the price system provide sufficient incentives for businesses to adopt circular economy principles.

Without creating a global, sustainable, green circular economy by the middle of the 21st century, it will not be possible to protect most species of flora and fauna, biodiversity of natural ecosystems, the biosphere and climate of the planet Earth from destruction, which, according to more and more perfect prediction models, may occur as early as the end of the 21st century.

My impression is you are exactly correct in your concern ""about the CE original concept versus the real way in which consumers act.

91-3,"Years ago (while training to be a military officer) I was required to take a course on organizational psychology, which, in the end, resolved down to that same lesson. Persons who share a common goal come together and organize to advance efforts toward that goal. The organization is more effective than individuals in advancing toward the goal. The members of the organization accept that their organization is more effective at advancing toward the goal. Their individual efforts within the organization disappear within the greater organizational effort. Each then accepts that they only need, indeed only can, contribute in their specific function. Their individual knowledge of the goal is no longer necessary for the organization to advance toward the goal. At that point, advancing the organization becomes the goal, and the original goal becomes functionally secondary, fading until what remains is just a token justification for the organization to continue.",negative,ResearchGate,
91-4,"Sometimes the organization, if it is well managed, can then move on to other goals that more effectively assure the survival of the organization than advancement toward or even consciousness of the original goal.

I still hear every day that politicians are concerned that the economy is not growing fast enough to keep the populace satisfied (and keep those politicians in office). In my post graduate studies I investigated the interrelationships of soil physical, chemical and biological processes that allow climax ecosystems to maintain the stable composition and structure that characterize them, and how our agricultural use of soils destabilize those remarkable natural stable systems. From that I concluded that human agriculture is based on disrupting climax system structure in order to give advantage to the pioneer species we use as food sources. I hope the similarity between our agricultural practices and our economic system is apparent. In neither case do we understand the importance of, and therefore doe not value stability. We do not know how to seek it, In fact, we do everything we can to assure instability.

There was considerable enthusiasm for pushing for government programs to incentivize farmers and consumers to shift to organic practices and consumption.

That is, my suggestion was not to incentivize organic farming but to stop incentivizing conventional farming practices.",neutral,ResearchGate,

Seems like the most obvious way to change that proverbial state of human affairs and effects is to cease to be regarded by humans as more valuable than iron...or water, air, soil, plants, animals... or each other.

The circular economy champions sustainability. The circular economy emerged as a strategic response to the linear economy model currently employed that results in disastrous destruction threatening the future of humanity.
Reverse logistics is the management of reverse flow of goods from the point of consumption to their origins where they can be recycled, reused, or disposed. The reverse logistics goes from downstream to upstream supply chain.

That means changing what we produce and how we produce it – both in terms of inputs and when it comes to the end of its first useful life.

It is no surprise that many products are hard to disassemble or to recycle. Product designers are not waste managers and have no strong reasons to incorporate end-of-life considerations into their products. The circular economy therefore requires integrating the entire product life cycle from raw material extraction to disposal (or preferably reuse and recycling). This can be done either through intensive collaboration between companies or single ownership of the product chain.
However, such integration has many disadvantages. First, if companies own the entire life cycle of products, they can easily cross-subsidize different activities, leading to inefficient production and high prices. Similarly, strong collaboration can facilitate cartel like behaviour. Second, if producers manage the waste of their own products, it may be more difficult to benefit from economies of scale in waste management. Finally, the upfront costs of owning or managing the entire life cycle may be too high for newcomers.

Sometimes the resource loop cannot be closed within one industry. It is possible to turn plastic bottles into plastic bottles into eternity, as closed loop shows, but many industries will see their waste being used as a resource by other industries. Linking up different production chains creates a web of complex interdependencies that can leave the system very vulnerable to disruptions. Similar complexities and collapses are quite common in other systems.

Many proponents of the circular economy set nature as an example. However, nature is not perfect. The huge complexity of ecosystems means that a change in one variable (say loss in biodiversity) can create a cascade of effects ending in the collapse of the entire system. In the same way, a cascade of events led to the crash of the complex and interlinked financial system, which in turn affected many others sectors.

Of course, there is great potential for reducing environmental harm in applying the circularity concept and many proponents of circularity see this as an important argument in favour of the concept.

range of challenges for the construction industry relating to ‘products, buildings and
infrastructure’, ‘recovery of products/materials’ and ‘business considerations.’ In
addressing products, building and infrastructure, for example, the Construction
Products Association (2016) drew attention to the challenges associated with the long
life and the complexity of buildings, the variable lifespan of many of their component
parts and changes in specifications and technology over time, which may make some
products effectively redundant in the future. In addressing recovery, the Consumer
Products Association (2016) suggested that the often low current commercial value of
materials and products, the lack of secondary market mechanisms and the lack of
effective quality assurance for recycled materials were barriers to the adoption of
greater circularity within the construction industry.",negative,Article,
184-2,"In a survey and follow up workshop of over 100 companies within the construction
industry, Adams et al (2017) identified a number of key challenges for the adoption of
the circular economy across the construction industry. Major challenges included the
complexity of buildings; the fragmented supply chain; lack of a market mechanism for
recovery; lack of circular economy knowledge; lack of incentives to design for end-oflife
products; limited awareness across the supply chain; and lack of interest. The lack
of incentives to design for end-of-life issues for construction products was seen as the
single most important of these challenges and Adams et al. (2017, p. 20) reported that
‘this view was held regardless of the company size or length of experience.’ The
authors also reported that there ‘was a lack of clarity on what the circular economy
actually entailed’ and that ‘the apparent confusion between terms such as reuse and
recycling’ suggested that ‘greater precision is required’ (Adams et al. p. 20). This must
be seen as a concern for the construction industry, but in par at least, it can be seen to
reflect wider views that the ‘circular economy seems to be a collection of vague and
separate issues from several fields’ (Korhonen 2018, p. 37) and that the idea of the
circular economy is ‘more often celebrated than critically interrogated’ (Gregson 2015,
p. 218).",negative,Article,

(2017) have identified a number of more general attitudinal, financial, structural, and
technological barriers to a transition to a more circular economy. In attitudinal terms, for
example, their findings revealed that risk aversion was a prohibitive factor in making
what were seen as disruptive changes to adopt a circular business model. A shift
towards a circular model was also perceived to require far reaching changes within
companies and to influence all departments and activities. Such changes take both
time and investment and where corporate financial systems are focused on rapid
returns on investment and cost savings this currently does not encourage long term
strategic change. There are also challenges in developing indicators or measures that
might help to monitor how a product or a company is progressing towards the circular
economy. At the same time corporate finance departments are developing and refining
tools to measure the financial costs and benefits of pursuing circular business models.",negative,Article,

require radical transformations to the economic order, including fundamental recasting
of manufacture, retail, consumption and property rights.’ Such radical changes would
extend far beyond the construction sector of the economy. As such, concerns have
been expressed that the concept of the circular economy might be captured by
corporate interests, and more specifically by corporate capitalism.",negative,Article,
184-5,"Based on the interviews conducted, five groups of barriers for the implementation of circular strategies were identified – they were: (1) budget and upfront costs; (2) schedule and project timeline; (3) lack of awareness and change resistance; (4) current construction business model; and (5) lack of regulations and implementation guidelines. ",negative,Article,
185-1,"Budget and schedule constraints are common in construction projects. The implementation of certain circular strategies may require upfront costs in order to enable future reuse of materials and components. Furthermore, lack of in-house expertise and necessity to hire external consultants was cited as a potential additional cost. According to some interviewees, certain owners are more susceptible to invest in sustainability and implementation of circular strategies (e.g., tech companies, or large corporations). However, some owners have tighter budget constraints, which may hinder the adoption of the strategies. While schedule-driven projects may leverage the adoption of some circular strategies such as prefabrication and modularization, schedule constraints might affect the owner’s willingness to implement other strategies such as selective demolition or deconstruction.",negative,Article,
185-2,"Lack of awareness and knowledge of building circularity were cited
as main barriers by nine out of the 17 interviewees. According to
Interviewee D, some of the circular strategies are new to the U.S. construction
context – which is the case of design for disassembly and
design in layers. He mentioned “there have been designers who developed
projects for future deconstruction, it has been done. However,
those were pilot projects, proofs of concept. I don’t think that we have
developed the best pattern yet”. Besides the lack of awareness, resistance
to change is a common characteristic of the construction industry (Lines
et al., 2015). According to Interviewee G, construction projects usually
have high risk and low profit margins involved, which is a scenario that
tends to discourage the adoption of new technologies, and ways of
designing. As pointed out by Acharya et al. (2018), the built environment
is not conducive to a start-up culture. Interviewee M agreed that
resistance to change is a major barrier in the industry – she cited the
following widespread mentality – “This is the way we’ve been doing
construction for years, why change?”",negative,Article,
185-3,"The current construction business model was cited as another major
challenge for the adoption of circular strategies. Interviewee B explained
that the construction developers’ business plan does not necessarily
follow the same lifespan to which the building is designed. That is, often
times, the developer’s investment is recovered way before the intended
building lifespan, in a manner that stakeholders are less concerned with
the end-of-life of the project. On the same subject, Interviewee I pointed
out – “sometimes is difficult for the owners or stakeholders to appreciate
the need for something that is beyond the period of time that they are
thinking about”. Rethinking construction business models is necessary
to incorporate circularity into the built environment. With a few exceptions
(e.g., the lease of carpets and lighting in commercial buildings),
the mainstream construction business model is based on the ownership
of materials and components for a certain period of time before they
reach the end of its useful life and are discarded. Interviewees I and K
discussed the potential to apply product as a service (PaaS) types of
business model to buildings’ facades and steel structures. The application
of this type of model would facilitate the reuse of materials and
components, as well as recycling once the end-of-life is inevitably
reached.",negative,Article,

as major barriers for the implementation of circular strategies.

Debacker et al. (2016)—the lack of specifications, properties and conditions for reused products,

urban mining concept and bring the new players into the industry that will be secondary
material producers with appropriate design profile; and innovative business model within
the market context such as “pay-by-use” and “product as the service,” leaving ownership
of the materials to the supplier [41]. It is also fair to note that the secondary materials do
not have a mature market globally in the construction value chain, and implementing the
circular economy principles into the business model is not obvious at the current stage [40,42",negative,Article,

We cannot reach zero carbon emissions if we do not address the waste problem and in particular there's one we're very well known waste problem which is plastic waste, which is what we focused on  finding an Innovative solution too ",negative,Youtube,

We all spend the vast majority of our lives in or around building. the level of urbanisation is increasing and will continue to increase and the built environment is the single biggest source of waste generation that we have to deal with.During the lifespan of the buildings and their operation, constructoin consumes the greatest amount of natural resources and it's growing at an unprecedented rate so these problems are being magnified. So the famous statistic that I'm sure we have all heard is two trillion square feet of new building stock will come into play between now and 2060 and every new building will generate waste during its constructuion and operation.",positive,Youtube,https://events.development.asia/learning-events/ecobricks-circular-economy-solution-transform-plastic-waste-sustainable-concrete
189-6,"So finding a sloution to make the built envirionments more sustainable will have a very significant impact towards reaching our zero waste. The problem is very intricate and complex, when you dig beneath the surface. So we look at plastic waste as a waste crisis that a lot of people are not familiar with is that of sand particular used for the manufacturing of concrete. It's the most consumed man-made material in the world and sand is the most abstracted natural resource in the world after water. it's being replenished naturally so just as the demand for sand for concrete is increasing due to massive urbanization population growth the actual resources that we depend upon are decreasing so finding sustainable long-term raw materials is essential",positive,Youtube,
189-7,We have innovated commercialized and rolled out in Hong Kong is a concrete solution but it is more sustainable because we've replaced natural virgin raw materials with local waste materials but more importantly we match or actually outperform conventional concrete and that's that's a very key factor um it's not just because it's more sustainable it performs as well or better than the conventional concrete products uh on the market. it's also a unique plastic waste solution because we can recycle plastic waste that no other recycler can and actually we work with all of the large waste managers and recyclers in Hong Kong to take waste that they've collected but they cannot process or recycle so we're actually additive to the existing ecosystem and infrastructure,positive,Youtube,
189-8,we don't seek to compete with plastic waste that already has a solution has a market for raw materials we deal with the vast majority and in Hong Kong that's 89 of plastic waste collected that's not recycled we deal with that whilst the rest of the industry is dealing with the 11 that is currently recycled and and those statistics are largely the same uh the world over in terms of the percentage of waste plastic that is recycled versus those that are not recycled um because of our circular economy model and our use of waste materials uh in place of natural raw materials we reduce significantly the carbon footprint of the concrete products and we've conducted a life cycle assessment under the iso 14040 framework to quantify our savings versus a conventional concrete brick using conventional virgin raw materials and we can reduce the carbon footprint up to 41 versus conventional concrete so not only are we finding an outlet for plastic waste that would otherwise have no home or no solution we're also making the world's most consumed man-made material more sustainable as well and when we talk about the circular economy solution,positive,Youtube,
189-9,"circular economy  can mean different things and it has different components. with regards to our solution we are circular economy solution because we take local waste we manufacture locally and as Terry said, in one of the most costly real estate markets in in the whole world and we use those bricks for local projects. So, that's one element of the circularity equation um but just as importantly circularity of the product itself is just as important and it's actually a largely forgotten part of the circularity journey. Producing a sustainable product is great that can be fully recycled at end of life is even better. That's what we have done so, we can recycle and we have certified this 100 of our bricks back into new bricks at their end of life so that's a very important part of the way we look at circularity it's not just the first part it's what happens to that product at its end of life and can it be recycled um and also importantly we look at the circularity of the industry that we're serving ",positive,Youtube,
189-10," We with our partners collect waste from the buildings that our clients have built and we use that as a raw material to make concrete products for their new buildings. The customer themselves and industry itself then becomes circular. As I mentioned we reduce the consumption of natural raw materials that includes sand that includes Aggregates and replace it with local waste materials. So the ecological harm that's caused from Mass Mining and abstraction, transportation of heavy raw materials across very long distances is avoided and quite uniquely compared to traditional recycling. Our recycling of the plastic is 100 cold and clean. We don't heat or melt or chemically treat the plastic which means we use far less energy and there are no pollutants effluence chemical byproducts from our process at al. So the manufacturing process itself is also low energy, low emission in itself and any waste generated including our own bricks again can be recycled back into new bricks so we can be zero waste from start to finish.

189-12,even further foreign these kind of solutions important why are they critical to the industry that we're serving and there are irreversible macro Tail wins and that the industry is facing which means that the future of the industry has to be more sustainable it has to be more circular it has to be lower waist and that pressure is coming from multiple directions and there are sticks as well as carrots to encourage the industry to transform its business model I think you know everyone has heard about the level of investor activism and BlackRock is probably um the most prominent and well-known asset manager pressuring companies that invest in to improve their metrics improve their sustainability credentials and and measurable outcomes and that is a very direct and coming from my background as a person Banker I understand how much of an influence that has on companies because it affects them in where it really hurts and that's in the dollar terms so there's a huge amount of pressure coming from the investment industry to push companies to do better ,positive,Youtube,
189-13,"Target by 2035 Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050, Dubai where I was recently has Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050. zero waste of landfill by 2030. these are very ambitious goals and the corporate world is absolutely key to governments being able to meet their these objectives that they've set themselves and again consumer activism should not be overlooked.Consumers have a great deal of power and if you look at marketing materials for virtually any product these days it includes sustainability as a core element of it. So it's becoming a key decision making for consumers. I touched on scope thre,  I think that poses a particular problem for the construction industry and the property development industry, because their supply chains historically have been very fragmented very opaque. And even when we were doing our research here, in Hong Kong and we asked the large developers where their building materials come from they did not know. If you take it a step further in terms of where there's a raw materials for those building materials come from it's even harder to have that data of invisibility. So it's going to be a particular challenge for the building industry to move towards scope three reporting.",positive,Youtube,
189-14,it's going to be a particular challenge for the building industry to move towards scope three reporting because the upstream and downstream elements of that are highly complex. When it comes to this particular sector actually one point to touch upon there that that's them in terms of scope three that's where the circularity proposition is very powerful.the  closer the product and the raw materials are in terms of Supply chains in terms of locality the more transparency. There is the easier it is to get um verified and auditable data from raw material to finished product to end of life so circularity is not just a fluffy notion it actually has very direct benefits in terms of scope 3 reporting and in terms of the size of the market.,positive,Youtube,
189-15,Obviously touched upon how much building there will be to quantify the demand for construction materials you can see here. It's going to be growing massively over the next few years and Asia will comprise a Lion's Share of demand for construction materials that means the problems I stated in terms of sand in terms of the carbon footprint of concrete is going to be a very real problem for the Asia Pacific region because it will see some of the largest increases in building stock and that means the largest consumption of the building materials and hence the largest consumption of the raw materials that form those um embodied carbon is going to be the next big challenge for the building industry and yeah and they've been great strides in reducing operational carbon but not a great deal of progress towards reducing embodied carbon because it is a far more complex problem linked to the scope 3 comments I just made in terms of Supply chains and raw materials ,positive,Youtube,
189-16,Targets on that we then looked at other waste components that we can incorporate and that includes concrete waste and our own concrete waste in particular and we can incorporate glass waste as well and we've started testing with um cement substitutes locally sourced cement substitutes and that's and that's quite an important um point I want to stress in terms of cement Alternatives um our focus on circularity so there are readily available cement Alternatives such as pulverized fly ash from coal power plants or granulated blast slag from steel mills Hong Kong does not have those so we could import those and we would then compromise our circularity so what we do is focus on what is locally available and that will vary from Market to Market so we our solution is to find um alternatives for local waste not rely on transporting wastes across borders um to satisfy our our demands so our circularity is very very laser focused on what is locally available and can be locally utilized,positive,Youtube,
189-17,then I think in terms of the technical aspects obviously I'll keep it high level for now but in terms of the technical aspects that we have satisfied and certified in Hong Kong we've satisfied all of the general specifications for civil engineering Works which are the industry standards here in Hong Kong. They are amongst the most stringent standards in Asia and not have we met the minimum requirement we've actually achieved grade A classification which even for conventional concrete equivalents is quite hard to achieve and not all manufacturers can achieve that so we've achieved Best in Class classifications from a technical uh capacity which covers compressive strength abrasion resistance and dimensional deviations ,positive,Youtube,
189-18,"Market differs very markedly so the waste ecosystem of each market is very distinct from another. so if we look at Hong Kong versus India versus Indonesia the types of plastics which are recycled or which are not recycled. The economics of the recycling industry differ greatly government subsidies differ greatly waste processing capabilities and capacity differ greatly so what we focus on when we look at new markets is what plastic is already being dealt with and what plastic is not being dealt with what are the Plastics that are waste burden or environmental burden, because existing recyclers either do not recycle or cannot recycle it economically. And again if you just go back to the statistics that is the vast majority of Plastics in every country, the model will always be localized it has to be localized, because it's a local problem that we're sourcing. So the first thing we do when we look at any new market is what does the waste management and recycling ecosystem look like; because actually the existing waste managers and recyclers are our partners in Hong Kong we do not compete with them. We work with them because we provide them an outlet for Plastics that they have no solution for which",positive,Youtube,
189-19,here Terry thanks so much for this initiative I think this is really fantastic and uh to to reduce sort of the the load of the of the concrete and the the bricks in the instruction in the construction industry is really a fantastic initiative uh really much appreciated of course we know that construction and demolition waste is a is a very big issue all over the world ,positive,Youtube,

189-21,opportunity I have a personal interest that's the reason why I'm asked I was asking this question we're we're now preparing a project in the province of shanxi the the one with one a Taiwan it's the capital where we have in fact a private sector a component through a financial intermediary where yeah somebody like you you could could be a potential even be potentially take a loan from us to to set up shop uh to to promote that circular circular economy in a in a specific project but also happy to discuss uh offline with you thank you yeah absolutely we've been delighted and we've been looking at um obviously China is such a big Market uh with multi-faceted regions and Dynamics um sowe've started looking at the greater Bay Area obviously because of the Nexus between Hong Kong ,positive,Youtube,
189-22,"we're actually working with Accenture at the moment to do a bit more of a deep dive into the markets understand it better get some data points to figure out what uh an entry strategy would look like. So what you're describing is pretty much accelerating that process very much so be delighted to look at these projects and initiatives, because for the the way we view Hong Kong is that it's a validating platform for our expansion  into mainland China. It's  obviously a well-regarded real estate market. It has very stringent civil engineering standards and building codes, so proving it validating it here both with the large private companies and also with the government's departments we think will be highly beneficial when we then look to expand into mainland China ",positive,Youtube,
189-23," so on the on the lifespan of a product, it will be the same as conventional concrete and that's exactly what the civil engineering tests are designed to. effectively predict by testing its strength and durability and weathering water resistance, so obviously our books have been in the ground for just over a year now. as time goes on they will prove themselves in the Real Environmen again the civil engineering tests that required are effectively designed to ensure the bricks are strong enough and durable enough to withstand the same weathering effects, the same abrasion, the same load bearing as conventional concrete for the second question regarding scrap leftover end-of-life products absolutely ",positive,Youtube,
189-24,"so what we're selling is not just a brick or a end product we're serving we're selling a service on the front end which means we are taking waste plastic directly from our customers from their buildings. so instead of them putting into municipal waste which will most likely go to landfill, they have a direct close Loop solution for that waste. By sending it to us, we transform it into bricks for their projects that's the front-end service we then create a product in the middle that we sell them. We will sell them a service that at the end of life of that product. so when they come to renovate the paving area and put new hopefully Ecobricks in their place instead of taking that waste sending it to the the public fills in Hong Kong we will take that waste back from them and recycle that into aggregate for new bricks how that benefits them it's it saves them the cost of the landfill Levy and landfill levies are only going up ",positive,Youtube,

The response was always well I do not know we have always done it that way and that's the worst dancer you can get if we know it's stupid and yet we've always done it that way well then surely there's something better that we can do and that's what really started to get my attention with the circular economy because I really see it as a framework to use start to solve and address a lot of these problems that we're facing in the building industry",negative,Youtube,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVBHnuWvEkY&pp=ygUnY2lyY3VsYXIgZWNvbm9teSBjb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24gYnVpbGRpbmdz
191-2,"so if you would imagine a building that has used nature as the technology what would it look like and how would it be different from the current buildings that we use. Well, it wouldn't look that different than a tree i mean it might look different but it wouldn't function that differently. It would have roots deep into the ground to use the mass of the earth to create heat; it would have solar collectors all over the roof to collect the energy from the sun and convert that into electricity; it would have the ability to sequester carbon in its finishes as opposed to producing carbon as a by-product; it would be healthful and potentially would be able to grow and adapt over time as needed and ideally it would be able to provide a habitat for more than just humans, but for other species. As well that really is what we're after and so that I kind of I'm describing a tree not that we should all go live in a tree house, but rather think about nature as that technology that we can use as the model to do that and we're just scratching the surface with being able to get there",positive,Youtube,
191-3,"We already need to know from nature or about nature to make this happen why can't we see this happening?! let's say yeah the scale that we need, but also like what do we need, what are the sort of challenges or barriers keeping this from happening in reality. Well that's the depressing part right, it goes back to the same answer that i got 30 years ago in architecture school which is well i don't know because we've always done it this way right. you have a no what is it nine trillion dollar construction industry or something insane that's very embedded and used to a certain way of building and they know that it's flawed and they know it's not perfect but it's what they know and so getting them to change is difficult. In addition, we have a code system throughout the world that's really based on three main materials: wood, masonry and steel and the code's written for that makes total sense, but if you wanted to use something alternative to those big three you'd have a fight on your hands, you'd have a bit of a challenge, and you'd have to demonstrate and prove that it meets these requirements ",negative,Youtube,
191-4,"we have this now with a product called mass timber. it's really engineered wood so it's a renewable resource it's a carbon sink. It's engineered to be as strong as steel but we've been slowly fighting with the code to get it to accept that it really has a great fire resistance rating because it's all engineered. It doesn't really burn, it's got a great strength and can be used on taller and taller buildings and the code has been slowly evolving here in this country to accept that. So that's some of the barriers right just habit and code but really i think it's human nature to be wired to be fearful of the new and so i almost feel like a large part of my job. ",positive,Youtube,
191-5,"my daily job is getting people used to new radical ideas as I really see all of our jobs as being filters right to take these complex ideas and filter them down in a way that people can understand them and relate to them and hopefully get excited about them. I feel like for the most part sustainability has come at it from this place of scarcity almost we've almost been apologetic I used to make jokes about this early in my talks where i where i i'd say gosh is it okay do you mind terribly if we don't put cancer-causing chemicals in the building; gosh is that i'm sorry to bother you but is that okay and we as environmentalists kept taking this very apologetic scarcity based approach to this. I'm kind of over that now, my mindset is much more i've got a better building here i've got ideas for better building not only is my building green not only will it save you energy in its operation, but my building will also potentially improve test scores in students, will potentially improve patient recovery outcomes in healthcare, will potat will potentially  improve staff retention in an office and staff productivity ",positive,Youtube,
191-6,"I have across the board i'm offering you a better building and if it's a matter of cost then we'll look at the upfront cost, but we'll balance the upfront cost with the life cycle cost. So that way you actually know what you're paying for you know we've driven this kind of developer scarcity mindset into everything that we do and so everybody's so fixated. On the upfront cost of the building and if it costs a dollar more they're like no i'm against it but the truth of the matter is that dollar more is pretty well invested because what we've seen is that for the most part sustainability features in the building pay for themselves at least 10 times over the life of the building and so if you're owning the building for any period of time you're going to want to take advantage of those of those benefits especially those outcomes that i talked about in terms of productivity and health and performance and so on you",positive,Youtube,

The construction sector is based on standards of productivity that have not evolved over the past 25 years.

193-1," ""The Circular Economy of Architecture"", followed by the proposal of ""META-Rig"". Meta means the metabolic change in social environment that influences the architecture. Rig means vessel, material component that used to form the space. So what it emphasizes here is an independent life-cycle of the material that is divided from the building life-cycle. Building life-cycle begins the moment construction starts while material life-cycle started long before we extract it from the earth. But often, building and material are perceived as one. And because of that, when the building hits the end cycle, so does the material and eventually, both end up in the landfill. That is just one example of the linear economy system. Packaging turns into waste after the product is consumed because no one holds the responsibility to own it. And built environment alone has contributed to a tremendous amount of waste. Because often we tend to change new packaging when the product is not satisfied. And in this case, the product is our space. The linear system has existed for century but was ignored until the waste and carbon emission has become a noticeable threat to the environment. And there is where a new mindset kicks in. ",positive,Youtube,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_YECK6_qOU&ab_channel=DavidNee
193-2,"A different way to approach earth resources, through rethink a system of package design that can be reused over time. Unlike recycle, it is designed to be repaired easily and redistribute without involved high energy to process the recycled waste. The final goal is simple, to remove disposal phase from the supply and demand chain. So that opens up a new possibility to think how circular economy can influence architecture. Often we thought buildings are eternal so it is designed that way. But many didn't realize that building has a lifespan too. End-cycle of the building isn't always because of the structural failure but also because of the paradigm shift of demands, due to the changes in social environment. The building that was built on the same year, might not result in the same value. But the value is justified by the need and sometimes, it is just because the content is less favored to the demand of its area.",positive,Youtube,
193-3,"And all it needs is to move on and find a demand that adores it. But how can the building find its value if it is tied to the ground. So that inspired the idea of breaking building into small parts through, Small enough to be relocated easily according to demands. Then invest on small component will be more worthy because the value is maintained with a constant demand chain compared to a solid building that might degrade over time. The building, however, is non-existent without material so it is just land or the material bank, for the investor to park their properties, to generate profit and everything will operate as a form of rental because at the end of the day, users just need the space but not to own material. ",positive,Youtube,
193-4,"Gradually, this practice could generate a network of supply chain through small component trading. And that brings out another challenge. The first design of Lego brick molded in 1949, still fits fine with any new Lego brick design today. It is made possible because of the consistency in grids and rules behind the interlocking systems. So we adopt this idea into the component design of the building, Through a three-dimensional recursion rule, to set a common scale and size to all components with a compatible joint. So the column can be used as beam, floor as well or the window as railing. Additional attachment can also be equipped on certain components to enhance the strength for loads. ",positive,Youtube,
193-5,"So that component will have more than one function to increase the chance for demands. And the beauty of it, is the efficiency of mass production, of a single design, a single jointing but for many purposes. Then we bring this concept into the design of an office. We combine the typology of the co-working with the conventional office block. For the small-scale pioneers that are collaboration-based. So they are more receptive to the idea of space sharing. You can choose between making your office public or private, or you can have both. All within a single set of recursion grid. The site is located in urban settings of Medini, facing to the lake and adjacent to the commercial lots. The intention is to maximize public space and interaction. So we divide the movement between pedestrian and vehicle into two zones. The circular office and warehouse will be located adjacent to the access road, so it functions like a custom checkpoint for the material before they assembled on site. Then we connect the site to the surrounding to enhance its exposure, physically and visually. And adding more value to the urban oasis, by bringing out all the service area to the first floor, to create a seamless connection from one end to the other end on the ground.",positive,Youtube,
193-6,"The forms are defined through the hierarchy of scale that seemingly ascend from the lake and allowing more views from every tower to the north. A single unit is adequate for a micro-enterprise and can stacks up to a maximum of 8 units, to the size of a medium enterprise. Expansion can either be done separately or they can negotiate with the adjacent unit if it is occupied. If the agreement is accepted, unit swapping can be done in just 2 days over the weekend. However, each enterprise can only expand up to two units on a single level to maintain diversity and the welfare of each party.",positive,Youtube,
193-7,"So in order to achieve rapid relocation of two offices in two days, every component are designed to be assembled and disassembled easily. The time frame will be determined by the workforce and installation time of each component. Since the nature of the building is designed to change constantly, supportive mechanism will also be the part of building utility, to ease the work. Each unit will be granted a maximum of 6 grid to be expanded. Installation will start from inner parts to the facades, so to avoid damage to components during installation. Heavier components such as structural grid or hollow slab will be assisted by attachment that mounts on the upper structure frame. Every component are designed to be mechanically jointed instead of chemical joint. So dismantle and relocation process will be made easier when the demand shift, without causing damage to the material, therefore no disposal. Smaller component will have a simpler connection that can be assembled by the user when it is just a minor alteration.",positive,Youtube,
193-8,"Circuit system is also designed into series of module that can be connected in the form of grids to simplify and shorten the wiring work too. And in total, it will take approximately 8 hours to complete the installation. With three workforces and a conversion of 520 to the largest of 775 square feet. Office swapping involves two units. That means everything will be duplicated including disassemble process. But if we divide the task into two days within a week, the work schedule of each day will roll back to 8 hours. From the look of it, you won't notice the boundary of offices, because expansions are interlocked in all directions. But what we can notice is the social culture of working environment, that is different throughout the impression of unit layout. Some are more substance where the others are more receptive. So the architecture impression could also somehow represent the company image to attract opportunity and collaboration with like-minded parties. But that results in the complexity of variations. ",neutral,Youtube,
193-9,"So a component database will be developed to record the quantity of components installed on each unit. This database could also integrate with software for the user to test and visualize the layout on the screen, before they send the order to the management warehouse. Units with the same owner will have the option to link to office, through a set of personal staircase module. Small enough to fit into a unit upon installation. As for the service system, riser will channel directly into the unit from the outmost layer of the building rather than the horizontal distribution from the inside so to maximize the flexibility for future changes. Layout of service system are also rearranged to have as minimal contact as possible to every floor. The riser will be designed in the form of module as well. So that it can be disassembled during the extraction of structural component on the event of building shrinking in future. In other words, it could also be the event of structural maintenance, in case we have new upgrades in the future too.",positive,Youtube,
193-10,"And after all, the lifecycle of the material will have a more defined purpose, that only cross paths with the building cycle. So when the building cycle ends, it will continue its journey with limitless possibility. Not only to modern buildings but also applicable to conservations, adaptive use or rapid transformation for demands during the pandemic outbreak. And the best of all, the more often a material is reused, the more embodied energy it could recover every time it completes a cycle. And suddenly material will be so valuable that everyone wants to take good care for its reusability. Until that point, people will no longer associate property to just area or volume but also preservation of earth resources that are limited and valuable.",positive,Youtube,
194-1,future today we are going to tackle a topic that's close to our hearts wallets and the planet circular economy and construction what circular and good for you but not a donut actually this is not a donut it's a biscuit but it got the idea if you guessed the circular economy you are absolutely right but don't worry we are not here to talk about diet is that we are going to explore some innovative ways to reduce reuse and recycle materials in the building industry I'm talking about modular design the construction techniques and sustainable materials and trust me the best part is at the end so stick around and let's get our hands dirty but before we dive in do me a favor and give that like button a little tap and if you haven't already subscribe to our channel for more content like this now let's jump in foreign,positive,Youtube,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81dgk5D4kGU&ab_channel=UGREEN_US
194-2,so what's exactly circular economy and why should I care well imagine a world where we could design and build without generating waste or pollution sounds like a Utopia right well the circular economy aims to make that a reality in a nutshell the circular economy it's all about designing out waste and pollution keeping products and materials in use and regenerating natural systems and when it comes to construction this means making the most of our resources and building more sustainably,positive,Youtube,
194-3,now let's take a closer look at the three main principles of a circular economy in construction the first is reduce minimizing the use of resources and energy during the design and construction and operation of a building reuse the second implementing design strategies that allowed for easy disassembly and reuse of building components extending their life cycle and the third one is recycle in cover operating materials that can be recycled and repurposed into new products at the end of a building's life but how can we apply these principles in the construction industry ,positive,Youtube,
194-4,industry let's dive deeper into some Innovative techniques and practices one of the most popular approaches to incorporating in circular economy principles in construction is modular design this is like the Lego of the building World modular design involves creating the standardized interchangeable components that can easily be assembled and disassembled this make it easier to use and recycle materials which reduces waste and extend the life of building components plus it's way more efficient than traditional construction methods some benefits of modular design include faster construction times with pre-fabricated modules ,positive,Youtube,
194-5,modules Beauties can be assembled more quickly than traditional construction methods reducing on-site work cost savings modular Construction action can lead to lower overall costs dueing to reduce labor and material waste flexibility Modular Buildings can be easily adapted expanded or downsized to meet changing needs quality control off-site manufacturing allows for better quality control and reduced defects so next time you are designing a building Channel your inner child to think Lego demolition is so last century it's time to embrace the construction instead so what's the difference while demolition is like breaking up with your ex by Smashing their car with a sledgehammer it's destructive wasteful and let's face it not very eco-friendly deconstruction on the other hand is like carefully taking apart a puzzle piece by piece the goal is to preserve materials for a future reuse rather than sending them straight to a landfill deconstruction techniques can be applied apply to anything from entire buildings to Interior spaces it might take a little more time and effort but it's worth it for the planet some benefits of the construction include waste reduction deconstruction minimizes the amount of waste generating during the demolition process,positive,Youtube,
194-6,reducing the need for landfill space job Creations the construction projects typically require more labor than traditional demolition creating new job opportunities resource recovery by preserving valuable materials construction can lead to significant cost savings on future projects and who knows you might even find some Hidden Treasures along the way now let's talk about sustainable materials you've probably heard about bamboo which is uh basically the Swiss Army night of eco-friendly construction it's renewable fast growing and can be used for just about anything but did you know there are loads of other sustainable materials out there from recycled steel and reclaimed wood to bio-based insulation and low impact concrete the options are practically endless by incorporating these materials into your designs you are not only helping the environment but also creating buildings that are more resilient energy efficient and healthier for occupants here are some examples of sustainable materials that you can use in your projects so recycled steel made from scrap metal recycled steel offers the same strength and durability as virgin steel but requires less energy to produce reclaimed wood sourced from old buildings reclaimed wood offers,positive,Youtube,
194-7,a unique heuristic Aesthetics while reducing deforestation bio-based insulation made from renewable materials like cellulose and chips wool bio-based insulation provides effective thermal insulation while reducing the environmental impact of traditional no insulation materials low impact concrete by replacing a portion of cement with recycled or waste materials low impact concrete reduces greenhouse gas emissions and conserves natural resources so next time you are looking for the perfect Building Material just remember one person's trash is another person's treasure or in this case a sustainable Beauty,positive,Youtube,
194-8,now let's address some of the most asked questions about circular economy in construction is circular construction more expensive not necessarily why some sustainable materials may have a higher upfront cost they often pay off in the long run due to their durability and reduced maintenance requirements plus techniques like modular design and construction can save money by making construction processes more efficient and reducing waste how can I convince my clients to adopt circular construction practices education is key help your clients understand the benefits of circular construction such as cost savings improved sustainability and increased property value and don't forget to lead by example showcase your own commitment to Circular principles in your designs and business practices ,positive,Youtube,
194-9,what are some examples of circular economy projects there are many projects out there from the eco-friendly bullet Center in Seattle to the fully recyclable cardboard cathedral in New Zealand this projects demonstrate the circular construction is not only possible but also be beautiful and functional and now the best thing of all by adopting circular construction practices we can revolutionize the way we build and create a better more sustainable future for ourselves and generations to come the potential is great we can reduce waste conserve resources and even mitigate climate change so let's embrace the circular Revolution and change the world when building at a time and that's the day for the video folks we hope you enjoyed learning about circular economy and construction and feel inspired to start incorporating this principles into your own work if you like this video don't forget to smash that like button and subscribe to our channel for more amazing content and since you are already here why not check the other video we made about AI in construction trust me you don't want to miss that as always thank you for joining us and we see you in the next video keep building a better future,positive,Youtube,

195-2,buildings i will also be joined by two special guests today who will be telling us their experience of working in this industry we will hear from grace di benedetto who is a structural engineer at arub and also eric corey fried who is the senior vice president of sustainability at canon design and also the co-author of the book circular economy for dummies but why are we here talking about the built environment today well here is a clip to help you understand why. So we have outlined three strategies in which the circular economy can help address the emissions that come from the built environment sector but now let's get practical and let's hear from some of the examples from the people that are making this work in reality first let me take you some miles away from where i am now and let's take a closer look at the building that it's at the heart of london this building is called one triton square next we will hear from my conversation with grace di benedetto the structural engineer at arab who will be telling us all about designing for deconstruction and what some of the economical and environmental benefits of this approach are let's take a look,positive,Youtube,
195-3,um i would like us to start the conversation by talking a little bit about something i read the other day i was reading the bbc news and i saw this article that said that a uk the uk's top engineers are urging the government to stop demolishing buildings and i couldn't help by asking but ask myself why are we still doing it so i i was like i need to ask this to grace that's absolutely right um it is a big question why are we demolishing buildings today from the outset it seems like it doesn't make sense we have these fantastic stores of materials that are high quality and valuable materials we've spent millions of pounds to create these buildings why are we letting them become piles or rubble and there are many reasons for it um the buildings that have been designed have not been designed to be taken apart they've been designed to be ripped apart and crushed for land for landfill or for downgrading so there's at the moment many logistical issues,negative,Youtube,
195-4,to actually deconstructing buildings as opposed to demolishing them and there's also a really big challenge around if we are to switch to deconstruction what are the costs associated with that and that can scare a lot of of clients um from you know choosing deconstruction over demolition um so yeah there's a it's a really big subject but i think the key the key item is at the design stage so it's what our engineers and architects and designers can do to change from the demolition to deconstruction and that's why we are here today to hopefully give the audience uh a little bit of an overview of what that can look like in in practice so what does better design for buildings look like and what specifically is design for the construction,positive,Youtube,
195-5,so design for deconstruction is a philosophy where buildings are designed intentionally for material recovery and reuse at the end of life so like i said currently buildings not only have zero value at the end of life they actually cost money to demolish and process the waste so instead when we design for deconstruction you have this fantastic ability to create buildings which act as these stockpiles of these valuable materials that can be easily taken apart and used in new buildings instead of virgin materials and in doing that helps us to sort of chip away at the enormous amount of carbon emissions which are associated with the build environment and in terms of actually doing this practically the deconstructed,positive,Youtube,
195-6,"like the ideal deconstructable building is very similar to a lego building so we try and design components that are modular connections that are reversible just like lego and materials that are robust and reusable and we want to try to avoid using any paints or coatings that might be difficult to remove and we want to ensure that the components of the building are easy to access and there's a plan for how they can sort of safely be removed without damaging the item and i mean you brought it this up in your firstanswer the importance of the design  stage and you know how much of our environmental impact is determined by decisions that we made. In that crucial design stage and i mean obviously as you speak it comes to mind that one of the benefits is probably you know reducing the amount of waste that the built-in vitamin environment produces, but what are other benefits that perhaps designing for the construction can have economic or environmental any kind of benefit",positive,Youtube,
195-7,sure so 11 of global carbon emissions is attributed to the carbon which is embodied in the materials that we use so in designing for deconstruction we are potentially opening up a stock of materials that can be reclaimed at the end of life and reused in new buildings which then in turn reduces the carbon emissions associated with new buildings and in terms of economic going for design for deconstruction. one of the challenges that's often cited is the increased use of labor at the end of life to deconstruct in order to to unbolt everything rather than just go through it with an earth mover involves a lot more people but that is a real great opportunity for job creation as is you know refurbishment of things that come out of existing buildings for reclamation is also a really labor-intensive process that that can create jobs in the local economy and grace you you work for arab and you obviously have a lot of experience working on the circular economy and and the built environment ,positive,Youtube,
195-8,let's talk a little bit about what is happening um already um i know uh you have a building that our audience has seen before in in a video called one triton square what makes this building so special or different from others sure so to start with it's a refurbishment project which is something that's becoming much more common um but it is still perhaps not the norm um so that project one trident square is an existing building that was built in the 90s and the client wanted to maximize the value of the site by increasing the floor area by around 70 if we were doing business as usual the design team would usually say like 70 there's there's no way that we can make that happen without demolishing and rebuilding but instead they found an opportunity to retain much of the existing structure while adding new stories and infilling empty space and ultimately this resulted in 50 56 of the embodied carbon um compared to a new demolition scheme,positive,Youtube,
195-9,That's sort of the um in-situ reuse story but the part of it that i find really interesting and different is that rather than replacing the facade which looked quite tired and perhaps dated what they did is they dismantled it um and transported around 3000 square meters of it to a pop-up factory where each panel was inspected cleaned and had the gaskets replaced and then it was installed back on the building which resulted in a 66 saving in cost and even things like paving and other roof materials were reused products from other demolished building  this is a this is a great example of of dismantling in a building and and refurbishing and a great example of a circular economy ,positive,Youtube,
195-10,but are these options scalable at the moment yeah i mean there's nothing about design for deconstruction which means it can't be used on projects of any size but there's definitely an education piece that needs to be done to develop guidance around design for deconstruction not just for clients but also for designers contractors demolition experts so they really understand the technicalities of achieving it  and i think to scale we also need more case studies and more large-scale demonstrators that can really reassure stakeholders and insurers and i think really big part of it as with many circular economy interventions is making sure that it's instigated early on in the project so this really helps to sort of bake in a culture around circular design ,positive,Youtube,
195-11,kind of moving away from that linear consumption thinking if you try to do design for deconstruction as a sort of bolt-on at the end of a project it really isn't efficient and it doesn't quite work so we have to bring this thinking this kind of bigger idea of the circular economy across the way that we design we make and we use materials and well everything around us basically ,positive,Youtube,
195-12,we've spoken a little bit about reusing materials the importance of design I wonder as well grace is there a market for reusable sorry recyclable steel or all these materials cement that are used in the construction industry is there a market at the moment and what can we do to create a better one or better conditions ,neutral,Youtube,
195-13,so it's in the uk it's at its very early stages there are some um some organizations which are ahead of the game in terms of providing reclaimed structural materials for instance for things like brick that's been done for ages that's really common material to reclaim but i think the challenge here is that you kind of put into this chicken and egg situation so for instance if i wanted to get hold of 35 tons of reclaimed steel i would really struggle to find that quantity of material in existence and so i probably would think i would maybe do a look online and i wouldn't find anything and because of that the people at the end of life the demolition contractors and the salvages they don't see any demand for these materials and so they don't think it's worth the additional effort to carefully deconstruct to store and to refurbish the materials because they just don't see people who are wanting it but this shouldn't stop us right from designing for the construction ,positive,Youtube,
195-14,"we might not have all the answers yet but we have to start somewhere if we want to make this transformation possible that's absolutely right,  i've I think with many things in the circular economy you often start to get almost a bit confused around the circularity of responsibilities. Why should we design for deconstruction when there's no market for it at the end, but it's funny because a while back I was making dinner and I got to thinking that someone must have invented the tin can before the tin opener and i googled it and in fact the tin opener was only brought to market some 50 years after the invention of the tin. Can so the inventor designed it knowing that it was something transformational but without having all the answers to know how it could be used. In terms of circular economy and design for deconstruction we shouldn't wait to have all the answers to start doing what's in our area of influence you know once we start doing what we can do that will start the engine of the circular economy and it will make reuse more viable eventually",positive,Youtube,
195-15,and back to the studio one triton square is an example of better using an already existing building while eliminating waste and pollution and reusing building materials now let's move from the uk to ghana in west africa to take a look at how the building process of some kinder gardens was redesigned let's watch a video narrated by the person involved in the project hayley greek who is the social infrastructure lead at arab international development ,positive,Youtube,
195-16,"this was a project that we worked with. A local ngo in ghana, called the sabre charitable trust who were focusing on supporting early childhood education. So the design approach that we took for this project was really an approach of kind of participatory design, where it was really shaped by the local needs and the local context in terms of the capacity that existed locally to build these schools. The materials that existed locally and the understanding of of construction we really focused on the materials that we were using so because this was a model school and it was to be replicated in throughout ghana ",positive,Youtube,
195-17,we really wanted to develop a design that could be adaptable to different contexts. So using local and material local and renewable materials was key. So for example we looked at using soil stabilized blocks instead of local concrete blocks. We looked at how we could improve the production of those soil stabilized blocks and we actually had them tested against some of the concrete blocks that were made locally and they came out twice as strong we looked at different materials for kind of acoustic insulation. For example so using one example that we used on some of the schools was coconut husks which was a waste product from the coconut farmers that sold coconuts in the communities and looking at kind of cement replacements in the concrete or for example local cement replacements the other approach that we looked,positive,Youtube,
195-18,at in terms of some kind of sustainable design approach was really designing the school that looked at the dimensions of the classroom and the dimensions of the key structural elements to ensure that there was minimal waste in the materials so i'm really understanding the availability of local materials the length that for example reinforcement bars came in the dimensions of timber components so that we could design a school that had minimal waste so I think the key opportunity on working on this project was to really kind of support local livelihoods and build capacity of local communities to allow them to not only build kind of a sustainable and safer school within their community but also to use the construction techniques and the materials that were used to then go on and build other infrastructure within their communities in the surroundings and the local teams are now fully ,positive,Youtube,
195-19,"To have full ownership on kind of constructing these schools and adapting them to different sites some have made and started their own kind of material manufacturing in local communities, like the seoul blocks or making acoustic insulation out of coconut husks or wood shavings. So the impact on the local livelihoods and the local community has been in the communities that we've worked with has been huge and that continues to kind of happen each year as they  roll this school out. The way these kindergartens were built used an approach that accommodated local materials and reduced waste in the process through a skill sharing and stakeholder engagement local communities ensure that they use the materials around them and that they implemented the principles of the circular economy in their building process.",positive,Youtube,

environment negatively throughout the
life cycle of development

will go through the definition of
circular economy regenerative systems
the relationship between circular
economy and sdus and to core economy and
climate change and examples of secure
economy in action and construction
sector i would like to start with the
definition of circular economy and why i
prefer to start with this because if we
are in a room i'm sure that each people
of the room will have a different
approach to circular economy so i would
like to introduce the one that i use and
the one that is followed in action where
we work
we consider the secret economic
definition from the ellen macarthur
foundation
which is based in three principles that
are eliminating eliminate waste and
pollution
circular products and materials that
they they continue the they're using the
in the economy and regenerate nature
and all
this principles
are clearly stated in the butterfly
diagram from the ellen macarthur
foundation
where
this diagram is a feedback system
divided into two systems the mechanical
cycle and the biological cycle
",neutral,Youtube,
197-2,"regarding the mechanical cycle
we start a brighter recycle of materials
which is
the um
the the cycle where the products has the
less value then we have the restore
cycle of a product
the reuse of a product and the
maintenance of a product and each of the
cyc each of the cycles contributes to
the uh to the system and then we have
the renee regeneration system associated
to the biological cycle
the biological cycle is composed by
biological materials that could return
into the natural system and that is why
it's
region narrative cycle
valorizing and appreciating flows of
energy materials and
information is the mean of the feedback
system that represents this diagram
instead of losing these resources they
return positively into the system and
rebuild and restore natural capital

good they are less bad but we need to
regenerate and uh regenerate and

reason why we need to focus and the caps

really important for construction sector
as a major resource consumer and as a
waste generator and
just to have an idea a number in mind
construction and demolition waste are
responsible of 200 millions of tons of

huge number so
the the products are still a focus to to
to consider and sacrifice and in climate

but some numbers about the use of
resources in construction sector
our sector absorbs the 30 percent of
destructive resources and generates 25
percent of the solid resources
globally and if we focus on europe it
source 50 percent of destructive
materials and generates 35 percent of
the total uh generated waste so these
are really huge numbers and great
opportunities for improvement of circular

substitute
the cement used in the soil cement layer

in construction to change the system and
to create value by
promoting a regenerative system which is

In 2021, PAM Building recycled the equivalent of 21 000 cars. and this crop metal is sourced on average

PAM Building's cast iron pipes are infinitely  recyclable without losing any of their mechanical properties.

fabrication to produce a set of building
parts that are so completely optimized

can be created without waste through
this precision of modern fabrication
these components can be detailed in a
way in which they become self connecting

screws and nails and rather than being
restrictive these parts form an open and
flexible toolbox for housing and shelter
this is not some prefabricated dystopian
vision of housing but a way of building
that is from its very design personal
it's flexible again through design we
have essentially democratized the how
building and unbuilding process allowing
those with very little knowledge of
buildings to easily adapt the space that
they live within now this is also a way
of building that rejects dependency

place and these components now they can
come together into a pallet and they can
move from site to site directly with
exactly the same components forming
grooves walls and floors the same
components working as internal
partitions or as temporary structures
and it's my pleasure to tell you that
this is not just some vision or fantasy
but this is an attainable future it's an
example of a completely reimagined
building industry one that stewards
materials from the cradle and the pure
natural ecosystem of this planet through
into useful building materials into
buildings and then at the end of those
buildings lives into new buildings a
gain and a gain instead of a building

layers of petrochemical mush now we have
a reusable assembly of naturally durable
materials in fact a material that stores
carbon in a structural geometry that is
inherently resistant to earthquakes

199-3,"this
is a way of building that is quite
simply cheaper more efficient and
stronger than the status quo but again
it's not all that straightforward as it
we as a species have an inbuilt
reluctance to invest in our own
collective futures you know to get us to
stop using plastic bags we
to end them outright what on earth are
we going to do with buildings we cannot
ban buildings the reason that I am
standing here today on this Ted stage
advocating for this is because a
technical solution is only part of the
answer to transition our building
industry from a take make disposable
industry into one that is inherently
designed for the future well that
requires human ambition and that
requires an ambition to invest in our
collective futures and it's for this
reason that I want to finish with a
vision of their future so imagine that a
young couple having a child and they
need some more space in at home quickly
and at little cost luckily their uncle
he's downsizing these components can
change hands and that child gets to grow
up in a warm dry and healthy home
",positive,Youtube,
200-1,"The issue is actually the linear economy in the construction industry.
A take, make, dispose approach or way of
doing things which leads to an increase in carbon emissions, which leads to a
depletion of our natural resources, our natural capital, the air we breathe, the
water we drink, the soil we use to grow food in the UAE.
Consequently, that take, make, dispose
approach, whether it's in the material industry within the built environment,
will lead to a decrease in quality of life.
But there is also an economic aspect of it.
When we take, make and dispose waste, and
what we call as waste is sometimes not waste.
It's a resource.
So we are losing material, we are losing value.
We're losing economic value that can be really reintroduced into our economy.
The challenge is, in my opinion, that there is a bit of confusion on the concept
of circularity or what does a circular material mean.
But it is important to inject circularity, to define it properly, to understand that
it's not only about recycling material, but it's about designing them to design
waste out, so rethinking the design of the material and others.
",positive,Youtube,
200-2,"I would say the first step is really being clear on the definition, and the second
step is integrating and enhancing the partnerships and the collaboration between
the different stakeholders across the value chain,
whether it's the contractors that is going to use the material or the manufacturer
that is going to produce, and the supplier that is going to sell the material.
How I see it in the future is actually
construction sectors where material are either give back to the technosphere, to
the production cycle, and as an example, any wasted steel products or gypsum board
products from a construction site going back to the manufacturing and the
production of steel or gypsum board, for example.
It's also a sector or an industry where
material not only go back to the technosphere or the production cycle, but
wherever possible, the material goes back to nature, whether the waste of the sector
is sand or glass or anything that can go back to nature.
That is also what I see defining circular
economy and what I hope to see happening in the UAE.

201-1,"The building industry has a tremendous hunger for new materials.
At the same time, it is responsible for 35% of all the waste created.
This linear approach is the reason for a massive loss of ecological and economic value.
Making building products circular is challenging.
It questions our traditional way of working.
But ultimately it leads to better products
improved ecological value
and new business opportunities.
As you all know, designing and producing circular building products requires a massive systemic change.
But we can make this change happen.
For some companies it is already underway.
In this course, their people will show us how they made the transition.
There are different ways to go about circularity.
Designing with waste is one of them.
New building products, like window frames, are entering the market
made from secondary materials, harvested from the existing obsolete stock.
There are even companies that take it to the more extreme
How can we design products without any waste?
And how do we make sure that circular products can be used an reused indefinitely?
Changes in design and primary materials
affect companies' modes of operation.
",positive,Youtube,
201-2,"Companies must continuously come up with new management schemes
and business models to support their activities.

building by our has started a number of
months ago when we started exploring the
idea of this circular economy and asking
a question what would it mean to build a
building in circle economy and for us
it's about starting to ask questions
based of ourselves as designers and of
the industry about how would you apply
circle economy principles to a
construction industry
I think we're continuing to to live in
the world where we don't make the best
use of the resources that are available
to us we still have far too many
negative impacts on the environment when
it comes to the construction sector and
other associated industry so we need to
start to rethink how our industry works
and how we can become sustainable in a
much more holistic and integrated way at
the moment we work in industry where we
design an object almost like a one-off
and then engage the suppliers and then
build it as one element whereas from day
one we need to think about how will we
deconstructed how we layer things up so
they can easily be demountable a
",positive,Youtube,
202-2," how
can we inherently design a end of life
and flexibility adaptability so it can
be applied to the circular come
so we started by by looking at South as
a series of components that actually
could be clamped together and then
disassembled quite easily so then we can
send them back to the manufacturers and
put them back into the manufacturing so
starting with the the steel frame that's
from offcuts from the other side it's
it's bolted together and so we can
easily rebuilt it apart it's also a
rigid steel frame so really we can
actually provide adaptability
flexibility with inside the form and
that's another element to the thick
economy on the steel frame we put these
prefabricated panels what's unique about
these panels is actually they're made
from agricultural by-product it's a
after you do cropping on-site until the
waste that's left behind so basically
it's a wheat waste
it's then compressed together with in a
non-toxic way and then these boards were
computer-controlled cut put together
together on a truck and brought to site
the challenge to us in the challenges
industry is is to create materials that
are non-toxic
",positive,Youtube,
202-3," when they can be
remanufactured in their life it's
a lot easy and we don't have any
chemical byproducts as well and so our
aim was and question to this to the
supply the industry and the suppliers
was to try and source materials that
could either be an upcycled from other
project projects in another non-toxic
way or we can be recycled back in the
manufacturing stream in a non-toxic way
the blue walls are made out of or Tech's
they're made out of 80% PE t bottles so
they're up cycled and actually just
pinned together so the prefabricated are
easy to take apart we can actually
change them over the lifespan of the
building and also we can send them back
to the manufacturer and give them
remanufactured into new boards as well
this prototype have been engineered in
order to reduce the amount of energy
used following the Passivhaus concept
one side it's the actual envelope design
which is it was engineered in order to
have high performances and reduce the
actual amount of energy spent in heating
up the building

into the house to provide adequate
indoor air quality we have used 3d
printing and laser cut as technologies
to develop this unit all the internal
components they are 3d printed with 90%
recycled Beauty which comes from old
bottles we only have discipline direct
current power originally we designed at
the building to have as little energy as
possible so all the system which use
energy for instance lighting or
electronics there are so that we have
the Tablas we have the TVs they're all
designed so that they can take either 5
volts 12 volts 24 volts 19 volts for the
TV and 48 volts for some of the lighting

it made sense to power it straight from
from the battery system

system that we've selected is a battery
system that uses a salt water solution

203-3,and i couldn't help by asking but ask myself why are we still doing it so i i was like i need to ask this to grace that's absolutely right um it is a big question why are we demolishing buildings today from the outset it seems like it doesn't make sense we have these fantastic stores of materials that are high quality and valuable materials we've spent millions of pounds to create these buildings why are we letting them become piles or rubble and there are many reasons for it um the buildings that have been designed have not been designed to be taken apart they've been designed to be ripped apart and crushed for land for landfill or for downgrading so there's at the moment many logistical issues um to actually deconstructing buildings as opposed to demolishing them and there's also a really big challenge around if we are to switch to deconstruction what are the costs associated with that and that can scare a lot of of clients um from you know choosing deconstruction over demolition um so yeah there's a it's a really big subject ,neutral,Youtube,
203-4,but i think the key the key item is at the design stage so it's what our engineers and architects and designers can do to change from the demolition to deconstruction and that's why why we are here today to hopefully give the audience uh a little bit of an overview of what that can look like in in practice so what does better design for buildings look like and what specifically is design for the construction sure so design for deconstruction is a philosophy where buildings are designed intentionally for material recovery and reuse at the end of life so like i said currently buildings not only have zero value at the end of life they actually cost money to demolish and process the waste so instead when we design for deconstruction you have this fantastic ability to create buildings which which act as these stockpiles of these valuable materials that can be easily taken apart and used in new buildings instead of virgin materials and in doing that that helps us to sort of chip away at the enormous amount of carbon emissions which are associated with the build environment ,positive,Youtube,
203-5,in terms of actually doing this practically um the deconstructed like the ideal deconstructable building is very similar to a lego lego building so we try and design components that are modular connections that are reversible just like lego and materials that are robust and reusable and we want to try to avoid using any paints or coatings that might be difficult to remove and we want to ensure that the components of the building are easy to access and there's a plan for how they can sort of safely be removed without damaging the item and i mean you you brought it this up in your first in your first answer the importance of of design of the design stage and you know how much of our environmental impact is determined by decisions that we made in that crucial design stage and i mean obviously as you speak it comes to mind that one of the benefits is probably you know reducing the amount of waste that the built-in vitamin environment produces but what are other benefits that perhaps designing for the construction can have economic or environmental any kind of benefits ,neutral,Youtube,
203-6,sure so 11 of global carbon emissions is attributed to the carbon which is embodied in the materials that we use so in designing for deconstruction we are potentially opening up a stock of materials that can be reclaimed at the end of life and reused in new buildings which then in turn reduces the carbon emissions associated with new buildings and in terms of economic you know in going for design for deconstruction you know one of the challenges that's often cited is the increased use of labor at the end of life to deconstruct you know in order to to unbolt everything um rather than just go through it with an earth mover involves a lot more people but that is a real great opportunity for job creation um as is you know refurbishment of things that come out of existing buildings for um for reclamation is also a really labor-intensive process that that can create jobs in the local economy and grace you you work for for arab and and you obviously have a lot of experience working on the circular economy and and the built environment um ,positive,Youtube,
203-7, you have a building that our audience has seen before in in a video called one triton square what makes this building so special or different from others sure so to start with it's a refurbishment project which is something that's becoming much more common um but it is still perhaps not the norm um so that project one trident square is an existing building that was built in the 90s and the client wanted to maximize the value of the site by increasing the floor area by around 70 if we were doing business as usual the design team would usually say like 70 there's there's no way that we can make that happen without demolishing and rebuilding but instead they found an opportunity to retain much of the existing structure while adding new stories and infilling empty space and ultimately this resulted in 50 56 of the embodied carbon um compared to a new demolition to a new build and demolition scheme and that's sort of the um in-situ reuse story but the part of ,positive,Youtube,
203-8,rather than replacing the facade which looked quite tired and perhaps dated what they did is they dismantled it um and transported around 3000 square meters of it to a pop-up factory where each panel was inspected cleaned and had the gaskets replaced and then it was installed back on the building which resulted in a 66 saving in cost and even things like paving and other roof materials were reused products from other demolished building buildings this is a this is a great example of of dismantling in a building and and refurbishing and a great example of a circular economy but are these options scalable at the moment yeah i mean there's nothing about design for deconstruction which means it can't be used on projects of any size but there's definitely an education piece that needs to be done to develop guidance around design for deconstruction not just for clients but also for designers contractors demolition experts so they really understand the technicalities of achieving it um and i think to scale we also need more case studies and more large-scale demonstrators that can really reassure stakeholders and insurers um and i think really a really big part ,positive,Youtube,
203-9,many circular economy interventions is making sure that it's instigated early on in the project so this really helps to sort of bake in a culture around circular design um kind of moving away from that linear consumption thinking um if you try to do design for deconstruction as a sort of bolt-on at the end of a project it really isn't efficient and it doesn't quite work so we have to bring this thinking this kind of bigger idea of the circular economy across the way that we design we make and we use materials and well everything around us basically um so we've spoken a little bit about uh you know reusing materials the importance of design um i wonder as well um grace um is there a market for uh reusable sorry recyclable steel or all these materials cement that are used in the construction industry is there a market at the moment and what can we do to create a better one or better conditions yeah so it's in the uk it's at its very early stages there are some um some organizations which are ahead of the game in terms of providing reclaimed structural materials ,neutral,Youtube,
203-10,for things like brick that's been done for ages that's really common material to reclaim but i think the challenge here is that you kind of put into this chicken and egg situation so for instance if i wanted to get hold of 35 tons of reclaimed steel i would really struggle to find that quantity of material in existence and so i probably would think i would maybe do a look online and i wouldn't find anything and because of that the people at the end of life the demolition contractors and the salvages they don't see any demand for these materials and so they don't think it's worth the additional effort to carefully deconstruct to store and to refurbish the materials because they just don't see people who are wanting it ,negative,Youtube,
203-11,but this shouldn't stop us right from designing for the construction as you said in the beginning we might not have you know all the answers yet but we have to start somewhere if we want to make this transformation possible that's that's absolutely right yeah i've i think with many things in the circular economy you often start to get almost a bit confused around the circularity of responsibilities um you know why should we design for deconstruction when there's there's no market for it at the end but uh it's funny because a while back i was i was making dinner and i got to thinking that that someone must have invented the tin can before the tin opener and i googled it and in fact the tin opener was only brought to market some 50 years after the invention of the tin can so the inventor designed it knowing that it was something transformational but without having all the answers to know how it could be used and and like you said lara you know in terms of circular economy and design for deconstruction we shouldn't wait to have all the answers to start doing ,neutral,Youtube,
203-12,once we start doing what we can do that will start the engine of the circular economy and it will make reuse more viable eventually thank you grace i think that is a great answer to finish this conversation thank you so much for being part of the circular economy show hi this episode of the circular economy show is part of our network workshop an event that takes place twice a year and that's designed for and with the foundations network these workshops provide a forum for social economy insights and inspiration and enable network organizations to connect learn and collaborate with other circular economy professionals around the world it's currently taking place online so if your organization is part of the ellen macarthur foundation's network you can register now at community.emf.org thank you and back to the studio one triton square is an example of better using an already existing building while eliminating waste and pollution and reusing building materials now let's move from the uk to ghana in west africa to take a look at how the building process of some kinder gardens was redesigned let's watch a video narrated by the person involved in the project  ,neutral,Youtube,
203-13,hayley greek who is the social infrastructure lead at arab international development this was a project that we worked with um a local ngo in ghana um called the sabre charitable trust who were focusing um on supporting early childhood education so the design approach that we took um for this project was really um an approach of kind of participatory design um where it was really shaped by the local needs and the local context in terms of the capacity that existed locally to build these schools the materials that existed locally and the understanding of of construction um we really focused on the materials that we were using so because this was a model school and it was to be replicated in um throughout ghana we really wanted to develop a design that could be adaptable to different contexts so using local and material local and renewable materials was key so for example we looked at using soil stabilized blocks instead of local concrete blocks um we looked at how we could improve the production of those soil stabilized blocks and actually um we actually had them tested against some of the concrete blocks that were made locally ,neutral,Youtube,
203-14,and they came out twice as strong we looked at different materials for kind of acoustic insulation for example so using um one example that we used on some of the schools was coconut husks which was a waste product from the coconut farmers that sold coconuts in the communities and looking at kind of cement replacements in the concrete um for for example local cement replacements um the other approach that we looked at in terms of um some kind of sustainable design approach was really designing um the school that um looked at the dimensions of the classroom and the dimensions of the key structural elements um to ensure that there was minimal waste in the materials so i'm really understanding the availability of local materials the length that for example reinforcement bars came in the dimensions of timber components so that we could design a school that had minimal waste so i think the key opportunity um on working on this project was to really kind of support local livelihoods and build capacity of local communities to allow them to not only build kind of a sustainable and safer school within their community ,positive,Youtube,
203-15,but also to use the construction techniques and the materials that were used to then go on and build other um infrastructure within their communities in the surroundings and the local teams um are now fully um to have full ownership on kind of constructing these schools and adapting them to different sites some have made and started their own kind of material um manufacturing in local communities like the seoul blocks or you know making acoustic um insulation out of coconut husks or um or wood shavings um so the impact on i think the local livelihoods and the local community has been in the communities that we've worked with has been huge and that and that continues to kind of happen um each year as they as they roll this school out the way these kindergartens were built used an approach that accommodated local materials and reduced waste in the process through a skill sharing and stakeholder engagement local communities ensure that they use the materials around them and that they implemented the principles of the circular economy in their building process ,neutral,Youtube,
203-16,next up we will hear from eric corey fried who is the senior vice president of sustainability at canon design and also the co-author of the book circular economy for dummies he will not only walk us through what is wrong with the current way we build but he will also talk about how we can look at nature not only as an inspiration but also the way we build buildings can also regenerate nature one thing i've seen in one of your previous conversations is that you all you say that the way we build is wrong uh what does this mean stupid stupid i usually say it's stupid wrong it's even better what does this mean well it's it's stupid i mean think about it we build in the in the dumbest way we make every single building a one-off prototype every single building is a bespoke masterpiece and it's built by hand one stick at a time layer upon layer with tons of joints with you know no opportunities to really reclaim that no understanding or context that that building is going to be remodeled at some point in its lifetime ,negative,Youtube,
203-17,and no real understanding of where the carbon emissions were that went into making it the operational emissions that are going to be caused from running it and and really no connection to the health of the occupants inside of it so it's it's silly and when i was a student you know studying architecture and i would you know raise my hand and say well why do we do it that way if it's so damaging the response was always well i don't know we've always done it that way and that's just that's the worst answer you can get you know if we know it's stupid and yet we've always done it that way well then surely there's something better that we can do and that's that's what it really started to get my attention with the circular economy because i really see it as a framework to use to really start to solve and address a lot of these problems that we're facing in the building industry and i mean you just brought up the circular economy which is obviously one of the topics i i want to cover in this conversation with you um ,negative,Youtube,
203-18,so when we talk about you know we need to transform the built environment industry um what are the sort of the you know the first things that come up to you for you there are so many issues and so many i call them market failures just across the board but let's start with the big one energy and its relationship to carbon buildings are responsible for more than half of the carbon emissions in our environment right if you factor in the uh construction assembly operation and maintenance of buildings it's it's more than half so we're gonna solve this climate crisis we have to change how we do all those things in our buildings not just in the operations but what we make them out of and you know it's really hard to build a building today without concrete and steel and yet concrete steel aluminum and glass those four materials alone are responsible for just the majority of these you know in embodied carbon emissions and and we really don't have viable solutions or alternatives to them yet we're trying but it's it's pretty slow going ,negative,Youtube,
203-19,in a way when we talk about the circular economy we always bring up the three principles so eliminating waste and pollution circulating products and material and materials and regenerating nature um what role you mentioned this briefly about what role does the circular economy play in addressing the emissions from the built environment sector well it depends on how you look at it i really look at it in terms of taking this holistic life cycle approach to it so for everything that we're putting into the building um what were the byproducts of of extracting it um how is it delivered and installed how is it maintained and what are we going to do with it when we're done with it so really just taking that holistic approach one of the things that i do very often with clients is that i'll run them through this thing called the resolve framework which i didn't create it's you know it's um kind of a standard thing but it it just helps me kind of organize the questions of okay well what you know um if if recycling is actually not our top priority but actually our bottom priority ,neutral,Youtube,
203-20,and our first priority is to design out waste that starts to really transform and rethink how we look at a building i'll give you a dumb example let's say you're remodeling your bathroom and let's say you pick out an eight inch tile sorry i'm american i don't do metric but if we do an eight-inch tile um well shouldn't that bathroom also be some module of eight inches so that way the tile space out evenly and you can avoid having a cut you know it always drives me crazy when you're in a bathroom and you see that little extra sliver of tile because someone didn't plan well well we can know that in advance so we can design the bathroom on a modular 8 inches and get nice clean edges that reduces waste it also helps you with other things because everything in the construction is basically on some module of 8 inches right bricks concrete block tiles plywood everything is based on that same module and so if we design to the module we can start to reduce waste in a very easy way and save cost at the same time ,neutral,Youtube,
203-21,many things that we can do low-hanging fruit that a lot of architects and builders haven't even addressed yet to really get us there and one one of the key things in our previous conversation that that you brought that you brought up was nature you started talking to me about nature as kind of like almost like the technology that the built environment should use um so what do you mean by this what can we learn from nature this is this is quite an uh obsession of mine nature is the ultimate innovation factory really right 3.8 billion years of research and development in nature and think about what nature does on a daily basis nature is able to produce energy sequester carbon manufacture oxygen fix nitrogen into the soil provide food provide habitat for thousands of species and it does all this without waste it does all this without massive amounts of heat right it does it in a beautifully balanced equilibrium based loop so there's a lot that we can learn from nature not even getting into dna and biology and all that other stuff just looking at the normal systemic ecosystem services of nature ,neutral,Youtube,
203-22,is just already kind of remarkable i there there are times when i just uh you know walk around in awe constantly at what nature's doing for us for free that we couldn't even possibly start to figure out how to do on our own or even pay for so if we start to look at nature as a technology that starts to change maybe our relationship with it it's not something that we squander it's not something that we destroy it's not something we consume but rather that we work in harmony with so if you would imagine a building that has used nature as as the technology what would it look like and how would it be different from you know like the current buildings that we use well it wouldn't look that different than a tree i mean it might look different but it wouldn't function that differently than a tree meaning it would have roots deep into the ground to use the mass of the earth to create heat it would have solar collectors all over the roof to collect the energy from the sun and convert that into electricity ,neutral,Youtube,
203-23,it would have the ability to sequester carbon in its finishes as opposed to producing carbon as a byproduct it would be healthful and potentially would be able to grow and adapt over time as needed and ideally it would it would be able to provide a habitat for more than just humans but for other species as well that really is what we're after and so that kind of i'm describing a tree not that we should all go live in a house but rather think about nature is that technology that we can use as the model to to do that and we're just scratching the surface with being able to get there and if if we know what um you know what we already need to know from nature or about nature to make this happen why can't we see this happening uh let's say yeah at the scale that we need but also like yeah what do we need what are the sort of challenges or barriers keeping this from happening in reality well that's the depressing part right uh it goes back to the same answer that i got 30 years ago in architecture school ,negative,Youtube,
203-24,which is well i don't know because we've always done it this way right you have a not what is it nine trillion dollar construction industry or something insane that's very embedded and used to a certain way of of building and they know that it's flawed and they know it's not perfect but it's what they know and so getting them to change is difficult in addition we have a code system throughout the world that's really based on three main materials stone um masonry and steel or i'm sorry wood masonry and steel and the code's written for that and that makes total sense but if you wanted to use something alternative to those big three you'd have a fight on your hands you'd have a bit of a challenge you'd have to demonstrate and prove that it meets these requirements we have this now with a product called mass timber it's really engineered wood so it's a renewable resource it's a carbon sink it's engineered to be as strong as steel but we've been slowly fighting with the code to get it to accept that it really has a a great fire resistance rating because ,negative,Youtube,
203-25,it's all engineered it doesn't really burn it's got a great strength and can be used on taller and taller buildings and the code has been slowly evolving uh here in this country to to accept that um so that's some of the barriers right just habit and and code but really i think it's human nature to be wired to be fearful of the new and so i i almost feel like a large part of my job my daily job is getting people used to new radical ideas as i i really see all of our jobs as being filters right to take these complex ideas and filter them down in a way that people can can understand them and relate to them and hopefully get excited about them i feel like for the most part sustainability has come has really come at it from this place of scarcity almost we've almost been apologetic i used to make jokes about this early in my in my talks where i where i i'd say gosh is it okay do you do you mind terribly if we don't put cancer-causing chemicals in the ,negative,Youtube,
203-26,environmentalists kept taking this very apologetic scarcity based approach to this and i i'm kind of over that uh now my my mindset is much more i've got a better building here i've got ideas for better building not only is my building green not only will it save you energy in its operation but my building will also potentially improve test scores in students my my building will potentially improve patient recovery outcomes in healthcare my building will potat will potentially um improve staff retention in an office and staff productivity i have across the board am offering you a better building and if it's a matter of cost then we'll look at the upfront cost but we'll balance the upfront cost with the life cycle cost so that way you actually know what you're paying for you know we've we've driven this kind of developer scarcity mindset into everything that we do and so everybody's so fixated on the upfront cost of the building and if it costs a dollar more they're like no i'm against it but the truth of the matter is that dollar more is pretty well invested ,negative,Youtube,
203-27,because what we've seen is that for the most part sustainability features in the building pay for themselves at least 10 times over the life of the building and so if you're owning the building for any period of time you're going to want to take advantage of those of those benefits especially those outcomes that i talked about in terms of productivity and health and performance and so on so that's it for this episode of the circular economy show we have seen that redesigning the way we design make and use the buildings around us is essential to decarbonize the economy that the circular economy plays a critical role in addressing the emissions from this industry and what some of the examples of these buildings look like from two countries in the world thank you so much for joining us for this episode and subscribe or follow us on this channel you are watching this video on if you would like to get notified every time we go live and if you've missed any episodes or would like to find out more about what we have coming up please check our website thank ,positive,Youtube,
203-28, i'm will hurst managing editor at the architects journal and i'd like to welcome you to this aj 100 club breakfast event our guests this morning from arab architecture are director nick jackson and senior architects christina cox and philip egan who are here to discuss their london office scheme for british land one triton square seen as a model for the reuse of existing buildings and one of the property developers first briem outstanding rated buildings the scheme located in the west end was originally designed by arab for british land in the 1990s in updating it for modern requirements british land initially looked at a new build option but then asked how much of the existing building could be retained or reused setting a clear challenge for arab which acted as engineer as well as architect and contraptor lend lease the resulting project was key in british land being named aj 100 client of the year last september for its pursuit of net zero carbon real estate by 2030 now before i hand over to our speakers i'd just like to extend our thanks to the aj 100 sponsors whose fantastic ongoing support makes these events possible ,neutral,Youtube,
203-29,speakers from arab architecture nick christina and philip they will now present one triton square before we take questions from the audience thank you will um right let me just share so hopefully everybody can see that um so thank you for this opportunity just to explain a little bit about the work we've been doing at triton square building's been on site for two and a half years coming very close to completion now and will emerge just as we come out of lockdown actually which would be very exciting um i think everything i'm going to talk to you about this morning really wouldn't have been possible without the teamwork that has gone on between arab our client long-standing client over many years british land and the contracted lenders who we're working very closely with and the what we've achieved on the project in terms of uh the initiatives around sustainability and particularly carbon i've only been realized really by the collaboration and commitment from all three parties to achieve this um triton square didn't come from nowhere arab and we've been working in this sector for uh over a decade ,neutral,Youtube,
203-30,really in terms of thinking about circular economy we've been going looking at it from a point of view of investment experiment exploration over 10 years we've worked in that sector developing a framework for property in terms of developing a brief that we use internally around the planning the design the use of materials all building around our approach to circular economy and this works across our whole business and is is a strategy that is is growing very rapidly in our our thinking work um our relationship with the yellow macarthur foundation is well established and we have very close partnership there and that works has worked through equally with developing an approach to real estate across a number of trial projects we've developed in conjunction with other partners like ricks and jll in terms of how we embed sort of circular economy thinking in our approach so i just wanted to sort of set that scene really in terms of where the thinking on project of triton square has emerged from that sits alongside our commitment at arab to align our business uh in in all that we do to the uh and our activities ,neutral,Youtube,
203-31,to the un's sustainable development goals the sdgs as a global organization we've adopted those uh 17 initiatives and goals to sort of structure our work at all levels and embed in our strategies around design work and the projects and thinking that we take on at the moment we see ourselves as sort of on a journey we're moving out of a sort of point of sort of green sustainable design and looking increasingly to how the thinking in our work can lead towards restorative and ultimately sort of regenerative design in the way we we approach our work in the built environment so that just sort of sets the context for triton the simple headline really is the work that we've achieved there um has saved approximately 40 000 tons of co2 emissions over the sort of 20-year life of the lease that is made up of embodied and operational carbon and obviously there are many ways you can equate that to sort of understand what that means but in simple terms in what a car does it's a pretty staggering figure um and that work has come from a whole series of initiatives there are some headline,positive,Youtube,
203-32,design changes or design initiatives in the project we've brought to it but there's a lot of other smaller moves um which i will explain as as we go through in some way so the project just to to give those who don't know the building when it was pre-let to denso aegis it was largest west end pre-let in the last 20 years we began with a design and brief that was about achieving briem excellence and that has moved over the course project to achieve briem outstanding which is one of the first buildings uh for british land certainly that has achieved that landmark and one of the few large commercial buildings of this nature that have been able to achieve that as a sort of standalone building that's not not linked into a large energy network it's half a million square feet we've saved forty thousand tons of carbon through the various initiatives we've brought to the scheme uh 54 reduction in the embodied carbon what we did demolish which was very limited um was and and the waste uh was all diverted to other uses so things uh initiatives like plant that was taken off the,positive,Youtube,
203-33,existing building has been up cycled and and reused exported and made use of we've made significant reduction in water usage on the building if you think the original building was designed in the 90s a lot of the approaches we can now bring to the design of the building weren't uh weren't available then and eight percent of the materials we we have used we've been able to responsibly source we would like that to be higher but that is sort of reflection in the marketplace that we're procuring from the building for those who don't know sits in the center of regent's place on the houston road uh it forms part of the knowledge quarter which as i think everyone will know is a very vibrant and rapidly changing uh sector of of london on the northern edge of the west end um and becoming increasingly a location for research uh and academic work uh that obviously has grown since the crick opened to the south we have fitzrovia uh ucl um and and maryland with with its education institutes and museums and so on um the trigger for the project really gathering pace was the pre-lit from ,neutral,Youtube,
203-34, british land that really galvanized the scheme into moving forward and the the approach that we've taken to sustainability and carbon has been embraced by the tenant by densu in terms of the way they're thinking about their fit out which is uh will start very shortly fully fully designed at this point the building will complete uh during april and be be handed over to the tenant team to progress into fit so the sort of thinking that we brought to this in a way there are some some big moves we've we've brought to the design thinking but actually it's all the small moves really that have been the the key to the changes we've made the uh the strategy was to really look in every area of the design every part of the thinking and and bring the same attention to detail about what can we do to reduce the amount of material we use what can we do about the carbon content of material what can we do about the recyclability or the reusability in terms of circular economy thinking to the scheme so that sort of initiative that one sort of sees and you know,neutral,Youtube,
203-35, in sports and so on and obviously cycling is a sort of obvious reference for that has been brought to bear in all sorts of parts of the building so the sort of headline story like all refurbished buildings is obviously we've been able to take advantage of repurposing and reusing the existing structure um bringing our engineering thinking to to that to to minimize the amount of new structure we need to bring to the scheme uh the the approach to the facades where we have removed large sections of the existing facades and rather than replace them to upgrade them we've refitted them refurbished them and brought the same material back on site and reinstalled them which is we think probably one of the first examples of that being done certainly in the uk if not in europe we've made other changes to the scheme which uh phil and christina will talk about in terms of things like changing the uh the staircases so they no longer sit within the primary thermal envelope and are heated all the time we've we've moved those so they're no longer part of the primary heated space they're tempered so they don't ,positive,Youtube,
203-36, get too cold but we've moved thermal line in the building to change the energy usage we've we've obviously replaced all plant on the building and upgraded that very significantly highly performing plant we've taken advantage of the capacity of the existing building to to allow that to to work in a highly efficient way and a whole number of other strategies that we've brought to bear uh our this the project has been designed by all the disciplines within arab so the the architectural team who now sit within within arab as a whole working closely with the engineering teams uh on the structures and mep side lighting acoustics sustainability have all contributed to this at various stages of the project and particularly in the analysis of the use of the existing fabric and materials the team the carbon team within our sustainability team put a lot of work into this in all sorts of areas that probably that we hadn't looked at before in the depths we have on one tritone square the brief was quite simple to us to make this make sense for british land as a development we needed to double the size of the ,neutral,Youtube,
203-37, building now that's a pretty simple metric probably most architects on on this talk will recognize on on a big refurbishment project or a rebuild project you need to achieve that level of upgrade that was a challenge with the existing building with its foundation system to create that area without changing the footprint of the building and we've developed that in a number of places which christina will explain it needed to be highly efficient we needed to be hitting very high net to grosses we needed to make sure all the operational areas of the building worked efficiently sustainability will and well-being were embedded right at the outset in the thinking about the building so we needed to produce a building that had much higher ambitions in terms of uh sustainability and carbon energy usage than the original building but was also still a wonderful building to be and had really good daylight really enjoyable uh building to move around and work into attract tenants on and that goes hand in hand with the quality the key value changes we brought to it were we doubled the floor of the building without changing the area of building given,positive,Youtube,
203-38, over to plant has a single basement highly constrained we put a lot of cycling into the building that wasn't there from the 90s building and cycling facilities and we've got the same area of roof plant we had originally it's a little bit taller maybe in plant but that area is working much much harder in terms of what it can deliver in terms of brienne rating and you know that required a very innovative approach so originally we were just looking at brienne was the thinking around what could we achieve and we moved that target from excellent to outstanding over the course of the the project and without really the level of cost increase that one might think was there uh now that cost is related to what british land would normally see as a uh their budget for a building of this nature but it was very marginal it was much more down to where we put the effort and really thinking hard about where we we spent our budget in terms of use of materials and thinking about the engineering so the original building arab associates building 1998 um built probably at the time that,positive,Youtube,
203-39,sort of you know canary wharf is really starting to together pace uh it was built as a support building really for for a trading bank it was going to be built originally with trading capacity but used by the the original tenant um uh was going to be a support building but it was big big building um set corner cores uh and it's a sort of low rise you know five-story building that uh sat and reflected the sort of horizon of regent's place at that time but it was a well-built building and the key thing is we had all the records and all the information on how it was built so we had all the drawings we had all the working drawings from the contractors like shelderbelt and we had our own design drawings and so on the engineering and that was a fundamental sort of prerequisite really in terms of the sort of re-engineering of the building that we were able to go through uh with the new design right i'm going to hand over to christina now who's going to take you through the the arrangement of the building um before we come back ,positive,Youtube,
203-40,to discuss the sort of structure yeah so the existing building is quite deep in plan and it has this um unusually large octagonal atrium um in the center of it with um a roof a roof light above that next slide please this is just an image um towards the end of the demolition phase where the plant is all removed from the roof the roof lights being removed and the top of the cars have been removed so in terms of the original concept for the building um the original design principles um included um the plan was um uh perfectly square there's these four corner core placements and on each um elevation there are these secondary screens that clad each elevation there's also a consistency of proportion from the macro in terms of the overall elevation right through to the micro in terms of the individual and panels that make up those secondary screens so when we were considering the refurbishment of the building um it was important to be considerate of these original principles so the key interventions for the refurbishment included consolidating that central atrium so bringing the atrium in from 32 meters across to ,neutral,Youtube,
203-41,17 meters extending the cores upwards and then when we extended the building upwards we set back those levels not only to create some immunity but also to maintain that consistency of proportion across the elevation and then finally just reconfiguring the main entrance area um to create a more dynamic um reception area that fronts onto regent's place so in terms of the building organization the four cores serve the office levels which are level one and above and the ground floor plan which is mixed use um is accessed via the perimeter so originally the ground floor had an undercroft that cut right across the center and the grandfather facade was also set back so we've pulled the ground floor facades out to better address the public realm to the north there's an affordable work space area to the western centre it's a large gym area with the cycle storage area in the centre of the deep plan to the south is the dedicated secondary entrance for the office a retail space and the main entrance facing onto the plaza in terms of the typical upper levels um as mentioned the atrium was infilled um so the hm ,neutral,Youtube,
203-42,has a stepped profile to create a more dynamic space the lifting strategy was looked at and so we've reworked all of that so the main um lift bank now includes an extra four four lifts an increase in the washroom areas um in the cars and also in filling the um [Music] the uh six story atrium that's above the original entrance not only to create more um floor area but also these smaller balconies that look out over the regent's place square and so through those just through those um interventions we managed to increase the office area by 85 percent and as nick mentioned with no additional um space for plan required thank you christina so you know that within that move to create this this almost doubling in the in the net area of the building um the work we started doing during the as the project developed in the early stages we're looking at really the combination of what the operational carbon was um which i think was sort of well well understood principle sits within what we do normally but starting to look increasingly at the impact of the embodied carbon ,neutral,Youtube,
203-43,key factor for us as we look forward to other projects that we're now dealing with is as the the energy supply grid um increasingly is moving towards all electric uh buildings uh we we see really most of the buildings we're now designing of this nature where we can we create all electric buildings as the grid cleans up the emphasis and the importance of really understanding the embodied carbon in the thinking around design is becoming increasingly critical and that underpins really i think the deep rationale we now ask ourselves with all our projects really across arab when when confronted with a proposal is is there something there we can reuse do we really need to replace a building or is there a way we can repurpose this building if it's if it's in one use how could you transform it into another use uh and what can we do in terms of bringing all our engineering and design thinking to that to to understand the impact of that because we see the embodied carbon now is increa increasing uh factor in the overall carbon impact of projects um so uh one tritone that i mentioned,positive,Youtube,
203-44,sort of principle of marginal gains this slide really is a bit of a sort of encyclopedia of all the different things we we tried to do on the building but it captures the key moves really around the reuse of the structure the rethinking of the atrium as a as an animated space at the heart of the building so it's it's it's like a found space really if you look at what it was in the original building it was a sort of pretty dead void like you find in many sort of 80s 90s buildings um we've retained the the facades to the cause which phil will talk about shortly um and then a whole series of other small initiatives really around either really efficient use of the floor plate itself which is one one version of making a building highly sustainable or simply uh looking at how we reuse things like you know the roof system we we've we've got recycled paving and recycled ballast that's come off another building that we've been able to use on this building rather than going out and buying new river ballast and new new slabs um from the from ,positive,Youtube,
203-45, the uh just for walkways uh the existing building 33 000 tons of concrete 18 000 tons of steel reused the the brown on this slide is the existing structure and the blue is the new so we we peeled a little bit off the existing building at roof level took off the roof lights took off the top of the cores took off the the mu tracks uh we've retained the body of the building um and we've retained all the substructure and so on there should actually be some piles hanging off the bottom of that pink plate uh and then we basically inserted this this sort of new uh structure in and around the existing structures so adding flaws down over the reception that christina talked about inserting new structure in terms of additional piling underneath the building to pick up the load and then a very light efficient composite steel and concrete structure going on top with all the concrete ggbs low carbon concrete so whilst we might consider now we might try and explore whether we could use timber for this though that's still very challenging in commercial buildings we looked hard at where we ,positive,Youtube,
203-46,were having to use concrete to really reduce the amount of carbon in that so we have this lightweight steel frame that drops in over the existing building our engineering colleagues instructors team did a lot of work to reanalyze the existing foundation system from the records we had in the design records uh and relocate if you like or or reapportion the way we were using the loading within the building uh because the building had been designed for dealing it had some quite high loading in areas and we were able to sort of transfer those loading allowances around it to create the capacity in the building to get this extra space and get the build down in the ground that was pretty heavy work in places working underneath the existing slab we had a low headroom piling rig in there uh where we could we were using um carbon fiber wraps on columns to to strengthen those and that was in conjunction with threading piles in so there were localized areas where we had to take the existing slab out to thread piles through but because of the analysis around the engineering ,neutral,Youtube,
203-47,the way because we had the records we were able to have confidence in how we combine new and old and that meant we could reduce the amount of sort of if you like caution going on in some of the design decisions to really make sure we'd optimized um the uh the design of that foundation system uh so nice view here through the the uh the basement while while that work was going on you see the distance there some little steel frames going up around so there were one or two columns that actually despite all that we couldn't justify uh when we analyzed what concrete uh the as built condition of concrete and so on so there were five or six columns where we had to prop the building take out columns knowing the reinforcement was there supplement that reinforcement and recast them in key locations around the atrium where they were picking up the highest load so this is the reformed atrium uh still very very generous space it's a fantastic space to be in and once the tenant is in there they're adding some staircases in i believe to run between floors uh will,neutral,Youtube,
203-48, be a terrific heart to the building a new roof light um let's light it down and it's got a very nice simple uh elegance of graphic quality to it um the the the concrete work therefore in the new structure 59 of that was cement replacement 40 less carbon in that element than we might have expected in a normal um sort of hollow rib type floor system um and then the last sort of part of this just in this short sort of discussion of what we've we've done we're just going to explain to you phil's going to take you through the approach to the facade which is pretty unique we we believe in terms of work on on a building of this nature really being able to combine new and and old structures so phil yeah that you i'll click through as you uh yeah so we had around 3000 square meters of facade on the building that was refurbished uh so this was taken off the building and sent to a factory in baseldon uh where it was kind of inspected uh cleaned up gaskets replaced um repaired and glass panels replaced if necessary yes,positive,Youtube,
203-49, it's just a photo of that next slide uh looking at the building as a whole um so we basically try to retain as much as possible so not including the kind of main entrance facade uh to the left-hand side there we more or less retained the majority facade from level one uh up to level six and we retained kind of all the stone on the course from ground floor up to level six also um so basically the double skin existing on the building is kind of the central part of the building so the outer of that skin was taken off and that was refurbished uh the inner skin um was largely retained again that was kind of cleaned up and any remedial works were done and the glazing in the inner skin was taken off and that was replaced by new glazing and was created more kind of energy efficient uh building the the lower part of that double skin um was completely removed and because the whole um facade has moved up one level also um so we kind of took off the lowermost panels uh the support and structure that fixed back to ,positive,Youtube,
203-50, the slab was also modified and then that was replaced back up on the new level six lab um so yeah move on to the cause uh as i think mentioned previously uh obviously we're retaining a lot of the facade at the low levels and we've got these new glazing um panels at the top which give us kind of great views uh out and around uh over the region's park over to the kind of financial area of the city and also up to kind of parliament hill um so these these sorry back to that one again sorry apologies uh so that's a lot of light down into the um the stairwells and also we kind of moved the thermal line back uh towards the office itself so the existing facade was somewhat leaky so we thought it was a better opportunity to kind of do that and kind of have a second layer of defense for the building uh yeah so again moving kind of from top to bottom facade so at lower level we removed um a whole band of facades and that was taken off first and then put back on at a high,neutral,Youtube,
203-51,level uh the outfitable skin was refurbished uh the inner hard neutralizing and more energy efficient we then got six meter wide uh terraces about level six and then from then we have a new solid upwards uh again all kind of energy fishing uh called the glass and also brisley on different facade elements and again just another shot of the factory in boston where the facades were cleaned up and repaired when necessary it's worth saying you know this is just a shed they rented to do it so all the stuff on the left has got nothing to do with the work on the facade really just very simple they needed space and the saving and transport on this by not taking this back to uh this was originally manufactured by sheldon uh not taking back to their factory uh on the continent was uh enormous when you you just totted up what the carbon impact of simply not moving this amount of material around europe so again yeah more kind of cleaning photos on site and i phil i think the the powder coating was all checked and tested that was all durable i mean might ,neutral,Youtube,
203-52,have been beyond warranty but uh yeah i mean it was all in very good condition uh to be fair so we only needed to replace one or two glass panels uh and again we had kind of existing spares so we were able to replace them like for like um yeah the the samples that we had that we compared against the existing ppc again was um pretty much kind of a perfect match so there was very very little failing on the existing so kind of a testament to the kind of original quality of the building and the panels that were installed and and the other key point of it was actually it had been assembled in a way you could take apart so not only did we have the drawing so we knew it how it had been assembled and put together it was all basically able to be dismantled you know the amount of silicon and and adhesives in this was very low really simple mechanical processes um yeah i just throw the shots off uh so to the left is the image of the three meter by three meter um glass panels that ,neutral,Youtube,
203-53,went on to the atrium roof obviously to let all that light down into the center of the building and then to the right is kind of current status of the building from the plaza so we've got the new entrance glazing in uh grc fins above that and then new glazing of that one okay thanks phil so i um we've as the project has gone on we have probably about every six months refreshed our sort of calculations around where we we are on uh the carbon content of the building both in operational uh and and embodied um obviously is a refurbishment of an existing building there's an awful lot of that you you gather simply from the existing structure which is sort of you know 24 of this and then 20 of the substructure but really everything else on that pie chart um is is the area we've been able to influence in the design thinking and the approach and the engineering um and the work with british land and with lendles to try and reduce not just reduce the slices but actually just make the whole pie smaller so in a way you could create ,neutral,Youtube,
203-54,the same diagram of this for a sort of new build conventional sort of building that we might see elsewhere under construction and not only would the pie be in a different shape it the pie itself would be much bigger simply the carbon content and so on so um and this is the work that our team within the the sustainability team have been working on and developing tools within within arab as a whole really that now on all our projects we go through so really the last part of it is to say this is all about teamwork really has been the key enabling uh aspect of this um in terms of actually the shared ambition thank you we'll also back to you thank you very much and congratulations on the project really really interesting and and not quite complete either um by the sounds of it the fit out you were saying yeah no we were we were we were due to finish the sherlin core at christmas obviously you know the last 12 months have not been the easiest time to to carry on constructing but um loneliness has done a fantastic job at keeping,positive,Youtube,
203-55,the project going with all their the support from the subcontractors and it we will completely shell and core sort of in about in the next six weeks or something um and then yes then the tenant team will will come in and commence fit out which i think is sort of the order of 12 months or something for them to fit out until it's fully occupied and alive sure um and uh we've got a lot of questions coming in which is great to see um uh so do do add your questions to that list um but do please keep them short um the thing i wanted to start with though first was um the point i think you made nick a few times about the fact that you um as a company had uh designed and engineered this building in the first place um and indeed for the same client how i mean that that was obviously crucial to the success of the project so can you speculate what would have happened had it been a similar office building that you were dealing with trying to do the same thing with but had been done by ,neutral,Youtube,
203-56,somebody else i think there's two parts to that one is you know from a sort of technical design point of view when you don't have all the information now you know many many projects of this nature people will spend an awful lot of time at the beginning you know trying to recover records trying to find records of piling trying to find records of exactly what was built sometimes you find some of it uh but not often do you do you find and particularly you know uh we we keep very good records now when we finish a building but probably back in the 90s and certainly the 80s they were less comprehensive um if you don't have those records you can't do the the accurate re-engineering of the way you're using foundations or the way you're using structure and so on and therefore inevitably there is a level of conservatism comes into the thinking about yes you can test things and and so on but you know there's an inevitability that you'll be more cautious and therefore you'll use more material in what what you do thereafter um i think the other part of it is,positive,Youtube,
203-57, we were able to really interrogate the building and work out how simply we could unclip things and dismantle things so the facade the ability to take the facade off was entirely because we knew how it had been put together and we were there for able to make the case that commercially that was viable that it wasn't something where somebody was going to price you know risk you know we all work on projects where you look at that figure that's called risk and scratch your head and work out well how do i change that you know you've you've got to change an awful lot of other parts of the design of the building to reduce that number um so the carbon savings would not have been as significant and presumably the financial cost would have been higher without those records definitely definitely there would have been an impact on that yes and i guess that's that's why there's so much talk about material passports and um you know the the concept of the architect and the engineer acting as kind of building guardians so they have a longer a longer role um and maybe get involved,positive,Youtube,
203-58,in further lives of that building um i mean how obviously this is a this is a special project and um and one that um you're rightly proud of but how unusual is it for arab is this kind of the way you're going to be doing stuff obviously you're not going to stop doing new builds but no no i i mean in a way what we're trying to say is we don't think it should in a way be a special project in in 10 years time you'd like to look back and just see that actually for most businesses this is you know the starting point when you look at a project like this um the principles of sort of circularity are entirely reliant on the the quality of that information and data you know and the buildings we build now if in 25 years time we can keep doing what we've done on triton it's wholly reliant on whether you know a the quality of the build in the first place was was at the right level and the the data is there that people can then repurpose and understand what they're doing otherwise it will ,positive,Youtube,
203-59,just be wasteful in in material terms and so on but as you you were saying that the cost is certainly on this one was was marginal you know really not much more expensive than doing a comparable new build um so is that is that enough to convince clients um in the you know in a kind of really important way so that most clients go down this route yeah i mean the cost premium was what we were trying to say from going from excellent to outstanding was was minimal right really in the context of the sort of quality of building british land would normally build really um the the increase there was was minimal um yeah absolutely uh you know i would hope all clients when they're sitting looking in an existing building scratch their head really hard understand what the embodied carbon in that building is before they start taking decisions to to and really i think that's beholden on all of us in current you know where we sit with planet and climate change and so on we have a moral obligation to be doing that with all our work but in i've heard ,neutral,Youtube,
203-60,um wrote dc and belgium talk about the value of uh materials and building components um and they've been involved in as you as you know i'm sure taking down deconstructing buildings in places like brussels and finding that there is a market for those um components is that is that something that you're you'd endorse uh here in the uk yeah absolutely i i guess there is just a question about you know one of the principles of circular economy is trying to keep materials at the highest level value level that they sit at that you know obviously you take materials off of a high-value building like this and move them down through the the sort of the built environment um if you're then going to replace them with brand new prime materials then you sort of got a question you know you you've effectively there's a gap there in in that embodied value within the material but absolutely and i you know i would hope that you know over the next decade we see that marketplace grows so that actually when we're specifying things on the building it's much easier for us to go out and look ,positive,Youtube,
203-61,in that marketplace and go right well we can buy there and the supply chain believes they can get it easily and therefore they'll they won't put a premium on it you know which unfortunately recycled materials still carry that premium because people think they're hard to find or get or be certain they they'll meet meet spec be warrantable you know we tie ourselves in knots with warranties yeah okay well i'm going to turn some questions from the audience now um first one from duncan walters who asks how specifically did the project compare against each 2030 letty target a1 to a5 and beyond okay you may not know this i'm not sure whether christina or phil close to that no um i that's perhaps one for the engineers yeah i'm not aware whether we've analyzed it yet against the lefty targets or not we've been doing quite a lot of work with letty so i suspect there's somebody i can go and find in arab to answer that i'm sorry that's okay and kirsten kane asks there was a saving of was it 54 or 56 of embodied carbon um what was that compared with um was ,negative,Youtube,
203-62,it a typical london office building of the same kind of size the embodied carbon is compared with a new build uh office building to i think it's the real estate benchmark um standard i mean it's pretty close to a bco type building that that's what that was compared with taking similar spec yeah down to ground including new foundations and a question from paul vick who asks about what kind of cement replacement product you use because i think you said that uh the new concrete you'd used was low carbon is that right yeah christina can you um i'm i'm not okay i it was a ggbs um yeah i think it was uh i think it was yeah 70 percent in this mix was the gbs um and that was used for all the new uh structure apart from there were some walls down in the basement uh which were quite a bit more kind of loading and quite a bit more strength so that wasn't used for that the six new columns we had to cast and then all the floor slabs i think wasn't it yeah that's correct yeah yeah and ben hare asks ,neutral,Youtube,
203-63,um who says thank you great project and great talk um you mentioned that you managed to use 80 percent um responsibly sourced materials so what makes up the 20 that might be termed irresponsible right these are tough questions yeah no this is freddie if phil maybe or christine i'm not sure whether either of you close to that assessment on that but i think it might be a damn kind of certification um in terms of kind of the bs um six double o one so uh it's it's quite difficult to get that certification for a lot of the materials so we tried our best as much as possible to get a certification but that is largely kind of related to kind of uk products so if we are looking at products that were from europe sometimes it was difficult to get those so it's not necessary that they weren't ethically sourced but just it was difficult to get that you know certification for them sure um and a question about the um [Music] uh the materials um i guess this is looking beyond to perhaps um this building having uh additional lives um ralph waterfield ,negative,Youtube,
203-64,asks how will arap ensure documentation is available to whoever might want to do another refurb in 30 years time oh well i guess this is a very very good source of open sourcing isn't it it well it is yeah there's i mean there's two parts of that i mean we spend quite a lot of time digging out in our records you know arab as an engineer like a lot of the big established engineers in in the uk you know from time to time you get inquiries about previous buildings and you know we keep our archive there and we'll supply data on other buildings when when asked um uh we're just in the middle of crawling through what the uh the record drawings and documents look like for this building at the moment which is you know pretty substantive but those will be very key elements so all the shop drawings all the uh data from the the construction side is is preserved um and then on our own side we we're very sort of fastidious about how we archive our own design records and so on to make sure they are available i think ,positive,Youtube,
203-65,just just add to that as well all the new facade elements um are tagged with little chips as well so all that information is stored back with the sort of constructor and so you can scan the panels and you know pick out you know materials right uh elements that make up that panel uh so on and so forth so given that the subcontractor is happy to release information later on that's all they're stored yeah i suppose the other part of it is i mean we have this as a full revit bim project you know and as as it was designed as a multi-disciplinary project uh you know we've worked collect you know with our engineering colleagues and and so on so the architecture structural mep model is a single model and all of that is tagged and so on and that is that's an important asset in its own right um for future and you know we're doing that with with all our clients now in terms of going forward so yeah and um wendy james asks if you can you apologize if if this was a point that you made but um was there ,positive,Youtube,
203-66,any um could you give us any idea of the cost per square meter on this project uh i'm not sure i can declare that at this this moment i just you know we're we're closing out on completion and the the sort of you know final numbers on that so it's tbc sure and how did you find um maybe this is a question you could all answer how did you find working on this project as architects because you know there is a sort of view rightly or wrongly that architects um kind of prefer to work on new builds having a blank slate you know you know maybe there's a perception at least that that there's going to be less creativity with something like this how did you find it from start to finish i'll let christina or phil take that [Music] you've you began you worked on it longest from the beginning um yeah i guess in i mean i've worked quite a lot on the internal spaces um yeah i mean i guess there is a an element of it not being a new build and working within the constraints of an existing building and ,neutral,Youtube,
203-67,there has been certain difficulties particularly on site as we've gone forward challenges that have arisen from that um but i guess seeing the bigger picture of what we've achieved now we're coming to the end of end of the project um it's been super interesting and a lot of learning for for me from joining this project as a part two um through to this it's yeah it's been great and obviously you're tackling something very very important you know this is the kind of cutting edge isn't it of how we make the built environment sustainable so that must be very satisfying i think in mature cities this is you know increasingly i mean you know christina and phil are a different part of their career than than i am but i think you know this is going to make up an increasing part of what we do we really have to look at an existing building scratch our head how can we make that work and only if there's some real fundamental sort of misfit in terms of you know what what it can be used for in in the wider sort of context of society is ,neutral,Youtube,
203-68,uh are we going to be sitting there you know taking things down um and i i have a young son who's about to start architecture school and you know i can see that his career is going to be a very different sort of profile of uh what my career has been like yeah um so we've got so many questions i'm just reading through them all um so ali iad asks what type of procurement strategy have you used on this phil do you wanna uh sort of design a build in this instance so we uh len leafs were appointed at the end of rba stage three which i think these days everyone would recognize now is a is a fairly well developed design it's it's not like the old rba stage d it's it's well into all the um and we were arab renovated across to lend lease and we work with them through stage four um all the packages and then it was procured as a series of packages i think i think it's interesting we did have kind of early engagement from the contractor as well and from the facade subcontractor which is very ,neutral,Youtube,
203-69,very useful so we were able to kind of delve into the details of the facade and taking it off and put it back on um at a very early stage which was yeah really beneficial yeah i i guess the fact permits to lisa gartner you know sherlock is a business is still there which is not not necessarily common among facade contractors sort of 25 years later and that they were willing to engage and pick up what they they'd done before was also a key part of the process and i think there was a slide that you used which perhaps was was more about the rationale um the overall rationale for this kind of circular economy approach and there was a bit of wording that said more carbon saved in design than will be produced in operation for 40 years is that where does that come from is that a kind of generation that's looking at the the energy the building will use carbon emission from that energy compared to operational yeah it's the operational compared to the total carbon that project has saved on the lease yeah um and stephen howlin asks did ,positive,Youtube,
203-70,excluding the stairs from the thermal envelope save much in terms of carbon well it has in energy terms over 20 years you're not heating those spaces uh it saves some and actually the point in a way is it's all all the small bits do add up yeah that was this thing of marginal gains yeah yeah so actually it's looking in every part of the building and going you know okay step there step there step there don't just keep turning over the stones and seeing what you can do was there anything you mentioned that it was dmb was there anything uh that that precluded you know with the sort of cost savings and the value engineering that came in is there stuff that you wanted to do that you couldn't because of that um i don't think so now i think it was a product smooth process it was yeah it's quite good it's a very open book sort of collaborative dmv process i mean the dmv is as much to do with sort of giving the contractor the control and the ability to run the project the way they want but it's a pretty open ,neutral,Youtube,
203-71,book process with with the client in terms of cost and equally it's it's bought off of a very developed stage three design rather than a sort of stage two sort of you know planning scheme where there's a huge amount of you know open interpretation and i'm sure it's very important that you had a a client who wanted to achieve an exemplar here you know that obviously you can make a lot of arguments to a client who might not be quite as on board about why it makes sense but in this case it seems that british land were really trying to push things as as much as they could as well yeah well i think you've seen from the conversations you've obviously had with them over the course of of last year um that that you know the value they put on their impact on the environment at a corporate level and the uh strategies and policies they've put in place um you know if you're going to talk to juliette morgan about the work she is doing within british land you know it's really inspiring what they're trying to do and how they're trying to ,neutral,Youtube,
203-72,change their own mindset on all their projects so that's the work at canada water what they're doing in the city of broad gate and so on you know those are all uh with similar agendas different projects different ways of playing out but the support they gave to the project absolutely fundamentally if they hadn't been uh engaged with that conversation and really pushing it then we wouldn't have been able to do what we've been able to bring to it yeah now a question about the steel um robert sakura asks um if you could say a bit more about the reuse of steel um did you have to melt it down and re-roll it for example well no no no no it was all wrapped up in cement and concrete i mean that's just that that's the uh it's it's stainless when you look at the amount of reinforcement in an in-situ concrete frame building like this you know designed in the early 90s with high loads uh there is a lot of steel embedded in there so i i don't think phil christine there's not an awful lot of exposed steel there's some of the in ,neutral,Youtube,
203-73,the stairs maybe i guess isn't it yes mostly in the cause and that was strengthened uh where it was needed to be yeah so no no robert i'm afraid we didn't take anything and melt it away there was glass that was recycled so there is some elements of glass that we weren't able to reuse and so that was put back into the the glass processing industry and was was able to be put down and put back in and melted um and now a question about the fit out mattia dibb um asks uh how involved will our be in the selection of material for the tenant fit out and to make sure the same goals are reached in terms of certification yeah well the the fit out's being designed by shepard robson um but with their client and swedish they are aiming i believe at the same um outstanding i think isn't that right christina yeah so they um uh we're we're not we're close in certain parts of the building obviously in conversation but our not we're not involved in that design work um i think i know the answer to this but um jonathan ,neutral,Youtube,
203-74,dube asks has the building been designed for future disassembly i mean i guess it hasn't because it was designed in the 90s and it's the same basic building it's the same basic building but everything we've done is capable of being dismantled so if if we we get you know further with some of the engineering thinking there is a an ambition to add more height to it at some point or change parts of it then yeah it's always it's all essentially bolted together now yeah and has um has covid had any impact on the ventilation strategy because obviously there's a lot of talk about offices and the return to offices like this one is there anything that has to be adapted with that or is the ventilation uh going to be appropriate well we had our air handling units on site and it plugged in by by the time covert came so um [Music] it's not going to have an impact on on what we've uh designed but the building is very good from that point of view it's got a 100 fresh air capability um it's a big displacement uh void system for for ventilation ,neutral,Youtube,
203-75,so it's already you know in that sense a very good uh system but um no we've we're too far down the line i'm afraid to start making changes to to things in light of covert and actually i think we're all also working out what are the right responses to you know design changes to respond to covert in that sense and what projects are on the um the horizon or the drawing board that uh in some ways similar to this for arab um well across across the the work we're doing in architecture we we have some very interesting work we're doing around uh retail buildings at the moment starting to think what they might be repurposed into and how you might retain parts or all of those structures but you know completely changing the using the retail landscape is very very different you don't need shopping centers of the scale you've got so we've got some very interesting work we're doing in that area uh we've been doing some work with british land on on some very nearby buildings and looking at how those might be repurposed and and enlarged um which is sort of we'll ,neutral,Youtube,
203-76,see where that that goes and then our you know our engineering teams are working both with with us and and with a lot of i'm sure a lot of the architects on this call across a whole number of projects with with the same agenda really and in some very good buildings up and down just east road where you see some of that work yeah okay um well is there anything else uh we i i've not really been able to ask all these questions because we've had so many so um apologies if uh if you've asked a question and not had it answered but is there anything um christina philipp and nick that you want to to add that perhaps we haven't touched on phil christine or anything uh not something we had no okay i i would just sort of emphasize i think you know there's the questions you asked about how do you make this work for the for the next iteration is a really good point that the quality of the information that we we leave with the building is is very valuable to the to the next generation um and and you,neutral,Youtube,
203-77,mentioned this thing of um was it bar codes on yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry yeah yeah and i the other point really is just to re-emphasize without the commitment of british land and lend lease to this there was no way we would have been able to deliver what we're delivering you know it's a holistic team effort and as i'm sure all architects on the call know if you're if you're trying to push in a different direction from your client it's really really hard yeah um but it's really really important we do this with you know all the projects we're looking at now we think really hard about how we we use material and what the carbon impact of it but by the sounds of it it's not just um well we know it's not just british land that are interested in this sort of approach how widespread is it now you know among clients would you say i know that's difficult to quantify but do you have clients knocking on your door saying you know we want something like this we've got an existing building um uh we do we do yeah yeah no it ,neutral,Youtube,
203-78,it is widespread but i i think the the stamina that's needed to go go the extra mile to to get that last 10 15 impact and and so on isn't always there um and the commercial challenges sometimes people you know that word risk i mentioned uh are often you know all the way through projects that haunt some of the decision making around more challenging sort of uh innovations and so on so it's you know lots of good clients are are in that area working hard at it um but i think it needs to be sort of you know a universal acceptance we we must do yeah we need the government to start pushing absolutely the levers of leaves of power yeah yeah yeah um probably got time for one more question um and this probably has kind of touches on your point nick about the grid and how the grid's being cleaned up where philip banner asks were you involved in the methods of heating and cooling um if so what what's being used here uh well yes we were we just redesigned all the mep systems um uh on this building it does have ,neutral,Youtube,
203-79,gas-fired boilers they're very efficient and all the you know the mep systems once we replace the plant and we've constrained on area the um the efficiency is radically different from from what was there before i think if we're designing this building now uh grid permitting and infrastructure permitting we'd be looking very hard at whether we were doing it all electric and i mean we're moving into building just developed next door to our offices on fitzroy street which we've done the engineering on for that for derwent and that's an all-electric building we're moving into and on that building we've gone right back to sourcing the uh the electricity from a power power provider who's using a regenerative system so we've actually secured supply of that electricity from a known source that we know is green and and that i think is the future you know less gas is definitely where we're heading yeah okay well thank you so much um all three of you for joining us this morning it's been a really fascinating talk and uh great to see so much engagement from our audience so that concludes our aj 100 club event for today ,positive,Youtube,
204-1,"welcome to the explore the circular economy show by the ellen macarthur foundation where
we talk about moving away from a tech make waste economy to one that solds out waste and
pollution keeps products and materials in use and regenerates natural systems last
week we spoke about how the financial sector is getting on board with a circular economy and today we want to answer the question
how do we create thriving cities that are fit to solve the challenges of our 21st century
my name is laura franco i am the learning team here at the foundation and i am very excited to be co-hosting
today's sessions with sarah carroll our network manager for the institutions governments and
cities team who are we talking to today sarah we have two experts with us today to
help us explore what the donut economics framework looks like and how it's applied at the city level focusing in on the city of
amsterdam as part of its ambition to become 100 circular by 2050.
so we have anarika doma the global cities the director of global alliances and
cities at circle economy and evelyn yonkov the program manager of amsterdam circular
",neutral,Youtube,12
204-2,"but before we speak to our guests we would like to show you a segment of the conversation i had with kate rayworth a
few days ago for this episode kate rayworth is the author of donut economics seven ways to think like
a 21st century economist and in the next 15 minutes you you can expect to find out what her
framework looks like why we need it and how she's working really hard with her team at donald
economics action lab to downscale it to all levels of the economy
so but for the for our audience who might not be so familiar with your framework um could you show us how it looks like i
think you have an image or something with you yeah i always have a doughnut on the stick nearby so here's
the donut and i offer it as a compass for 21st century prosperity
so the idea is imagine humanity's use of earth resources radiating out from the middle of this
picture and that means the hole in the middle is a place where people don't have the
essentials of life they don't have the food water healthcare housing education income
",negative,Youtube,
204-3,"political voice gender equality that every person has a claim to we must leave no person in the world in the whole of
this donut get everybody over the social foundation and into the green ring itself
that was even a 20th century ambition to meet the needs of all but in the 21st
century we know more we know that if we try to do this in a way that excessively and misuses
earth's resources we push ourselves beyond this ecological ceiling we start to break down the
life-supporting systems of planet earth on which all of our lives depend and we cause climate breakdown and we acidify
the oceans we create a hole in the ozone layer catastrophic levels of biodiversity loss
and these are the nine planetary boundaries that earth system scientists say are the life-supporting systems that
make this planet the one habitable planet of life in the universe
that we know of so we'd be crazy to kick ourselves out if you put those two together
the goal of getting into the donut is to meet the needs of all people
within the means of the living planet it's that simple the question is how
",positive,Youtube,
204-4,"
do we get there and
i believe we need to create a regenerative and distributive economy to take us in that direction okay do you
we've spoken about you've shown us a very different picture as you say from that crisscross supply demand diagram
that we are all presented with in our first day in in economics bachelors uh or in any degree um but
um what i'm thinking now is where where is the economy in your framework what kind of of thinking do economist
economists in the 21st century need because in in the diagram we can see the planetary boundaries the social
foundations but where are the economics yeah it's a really good question because because an economist might say well i
can't see the economy here where is it and i very intentionally took away the
normal indicators that we start with of the economy because i wanted to say let's start with the fundamentals
let's start with the fundamental of human well-being and these are drawn from the sustainable development goals so all the governments in the world have
already agreed that all the people in the world have a claim to meeting these essential 
",neutral,Youtube,
204-5,"needs and let's start with the fundamentals of
planetary health i mean after all economics means the art of household management how the heck can you presume to manage
the household if you'd even don't even understand it so let's understand this household its planetary boundaries let's
understand its people and their essential needs now we've put in place the fundamentals of economics now we can invite
economic thinking and reasoning into the room and say what kind of institutions what
balance between market state household and commons what kind of incentives and regulations
will enable us to meet these goals and the economy is here i've written it here it says regenerative
and distributive economy and the reason that's what i wrote is because i believe what we need to focus on
is creating dynamics that start bringing us into the donut because right now we are way outside on both sides billions
of people fall short on their essential needs and we're overshooting multiple planetary boundaries and what that tells
us is we have an economy that's deeply degenerative we are running down the life supporting systems of our planet
and we need to transform that degenerative dynamic 
",negative,Youtube,
204-6,"into a regenerative dynamic where we work with and within
the cycles of the living world but we also have an economy that's deeply divisive
where the returns of value and opportunity are so often driven into the hands of a one percent so we have
billions of people who can't meet their essential needs and a doubling of number of billionaires in the world in the past
decade so we need to turn this divisive economic dynamics into distributive economic dynamics so
for me the 21st century economy is absolutely in the donut the question is how are we going to make
our economy regenerative and how are we going to make it distributive and that is their that's
the entry point now let's talk about economics in those terms let's reframe the starting point and let's dive in from there
so important to talk about about framing and what i'm getting is that you basically are thinking about two main
principles for the economy so it has to be regenerative by design and distributed by design and i think a lot of the work of what we do at the
macarthur foundation overlaps here with with the work 
",positive,Youtube,
204-7,"that you do um because because we want to have a
regenerative economy and i wanted to ask you kate um as part of this what role do you think the circular
economy plays in these i think it's key so let me grab my favorite piece of hosepipe
you know this is our degenerative economy it's the linear take make use lose of industrial systems
that we've inherited and that linear degenerative process is what pushes us over planetary boundaries it
takes again and again from earth sources it throws waste again and again into earth sinks
we have to turn this linear arrow into a circular one right we have to work
with and within the cycles of the living world so that resources are never used up they're used again and again far more collectively more creatively
and more carefully and more slowly so i think a circular economy is
a necessity in the search of becoming regenerative it's we can't do it without reusing
resources and recognizing that waste from one process is food for the next how do we make that distributive at the
same time for me that's the really interesting question how do 
",positive,Youtube,
204-8,"we make sure that the circular economy not only takes us towards regenerative design
it takes us towards distributive design so for example i believe we need industries where that
make products that have the right to repair that are modular by design so that instead of individual companies having
their own circular supply chain send everything back to me and it's within my intellectual property rights and these
are my materials and nobody else knows how i use them and it's a kind of corporate loop that
is never going to work because nature doesn't do that nature doesn't create a series of 100 little loops
nature creates an ecosystem right nature puts resources back into the ecosystem
back as basic building blocks and then starts again so if we want to mimic nature in the way we create circular economies
we need an ecosystem of plastics use an ecosystem of metals and an ecosystem of electronics and an
ecosystem of ceramics and that means that the materials need to be labeled and open source in their design
so anyone who ends up with a material in their hand knows what kind of material it is and is
",positive,Youtube,
204-9,"able to feed it back into the ecosystem
so i think it has really far-reaching implications for ensuring that we don't go down this
corporate siloed circularity but that we have a ecosystem
circularity and that requires a regulation and a collaboration between industries to make that
ecosystem and to make those shared commons based technologies and shared
standards that everybody can connect to but also i would say that the circular economy has a huge potential
to be an employment creating a job creating and a meaningful job creating
economy right there's there's creativity and joy and meaning in figuring out how to use earth
resources again and again how to repurpose them what can they become next time so it enables architects and engineers
and designers to be innovative and to come up with new solutions and those are the folks i meet who work in big companies
who can't wait to get going making these new designs they're often held behind a
lobby a kind of corporate lobby that are trying to stop any change in regulations but if only that corporate lobby would
get out the way and the regulations could be changed the innovative inspiration 
",positive,Youtube,
204-10,"of that generation 
designers can be unleashed and so there's a lot of good jobs i mean again if i bring back this network
think of all the jobs required to make the connections between these nodes it is an employment creating uh system
so that's another way in which it can be distributed by design so i think it connects very closely with the work of the element class foundation
and i think the question always is how do we ensure that as we promote the circular economy it doesn't become a siloed corporate
captured circular economy it becomes part of a large ecosystem and it's distributed by design as well
and this shows the the importance of having a system approach and and really including all the actors of our economy and not just the
businesses but also the policymakers the academics and the communities et cetera so you're presenting us with a
very different picture that can set the very different indicators and and and ultimately lead to different
policies different businesses and different ways of of doing stuff um and and you mentioned you published
the donut in 2012 your book in 2017 and i know 
",neutral,Youtube,
204-11,"you've been working really
hard on on how to downscale this this this framework which can
perhaps seem a bit theoretical and and how to actually apply it to the different levels of the economy
um so cities why why are you focusing on city scale and and how do you how do you move from that
image that framework to actually uh talking about uh the city level yeah so when the donut was first
published in 2012 it is a it is a compass for the global
or the planetary scale it tries to plot all of humanity within the planetary boundaries
and very quickly people started saying can we turn that into a tool for here
for our city our town our nation our country and wanted to downscale it and for years
we couldn't figure out how would you downscale it what would that look like what's the smart way to do that and then i got into a fantastic
conversation with the biomimicry thinker janine benius who
had sort of flipped the donut inside out as it were and had this idea for for using it and we put our ideas together
",neutral,Youtube,
204-12,"and we came up with a framework for down scaling it which i feel very confident has a huge ability to be applied at
multiple scales so it could be applied from a neighborhood to a town to a city to a district to a nation
or even to a community of nations and we've started with cities partly because there's a real energy
going on in cities in these current decades there's something about cities is it that they're the right size that
they can make a difference but they're not so big that people can't connect there's a pride certainly
here in the uk i think people feel more of a pride of the city that they're part of rather than saying i'm proud to be
part of the uk so there's more of a connection with that level of place
and also a lot of creating economic transformation happens in the way we lay out our
streets in the way we move materials around so there's something about the spatial scale of a city that can
try out new things we also got in touch with the c40 which is a network of 96 cities with mayors 
",positive,Youtube,
204-13,"
who have committed
to transforming their cities to keep global heating under 1.5 degrees and they said we'd like to use the donut
with some of our most ambitious cities so we started working together that's how we began the work with cities and we've actually begun in the cities
of the global north in the high income countries because we think they have the greatest obligation
and responsibility to lead this transformation given their historic responsibilities for climate
and ecological impacts so we've begun with them and um so in for cities
i know you have four main lenses that you look at when you try to approach the donut framework
what what what are they and and why was it so important to incorporate as well the global
perspective so here's the question that we invite any ambitious
city any city that wants to be fit for the 21st century we invite it to ask itself and i and i
just would invite anybody listening to this to think of a city that they know and love
and look at it through this lens so here's the question how can your city be a home to thriving people
",positive,Youtube,
204-14,"in a thriving place while respecting the well-being of all
people and the health of the whole planet so that's a big question and you can hear
in it there's both local aspiration to be thriving people whatever it means to the
people of your city you know what it means to thrive will be different to the people of darussalam
as to the people of stockholm so let each culture and community bring their history their meaning
their way of living and say this is what it means to thrive here for us and how are we doing against that and
then also part of the local aspiration what does it mean for your city to be a part of a thriving place
every city on the planet is located in a different part of earth's ecosystems some are mountains some are in valleys
some are in the equator somewhere in the arctic circle and what nature's doing in those places
varies so nature has a genius as janine benious would say of thriving different in each of these
places and we can learn from nature and aim for our cities to belong in that habitat
",neutral,Youtube,
204-15,"so let's say i'm in the city of oxford in the uk and and the nearest natural habitat is a place called white
and woods just a couple of miles outside the city i could go to white and woods and say this is what nature's doing here this is how
nature thrives and let's take the measurements of white to wood let's measure how much carbon dioxide these woods are
sequestering how much groundwater they're storing after a storm how much biodiversity the woods are
housing how much the woods are cooling the air in the summer from the treetops to the forest floor so
we take the metrics of nature and we say what would it mean for our city to aim to actually
match or even exceed the generosity of the wildland next door so that our cities would be functionally
indistinct from the wildland in which they're embedded as janine would say we we humans come to truly belong in the
landscapes in which we are nestled so that's local aspiration to be thriving people in a thriving place
and many cities just focus on that we want to have good lives for our residents 
",positive,Youtube,
204-16,"we want to have clean air and
clean water and nature nearby but that local aspiration has to be set
in the context of global responsibility because every city draws in resources from other parts of
the world and is having an impact on people and planet worldwide and we have to recognize that
so we also ask how can your city aim to thrive while respecting the the well-being of
people worldwide think of all the food that's imported into a city every day the clothing the electronics goods the
material consumer goods the construction materials whose labor went into picking and
packing that food or stitching the clothes and packaging and transporting mining the
construction materials because people's labor and their communities worldwide have been affected
for good or for bad have been affected through the supply chains that are connected to the city
how can this city transform its supply chain through the way the government procures public goods through the through the products that
are on sale in the city through the lifestyle that we aspire to in the city so that we have far better impacts on
",positive,Youtube,
204-17,"the lives of people worldwide and then the last lens is how do we ensure the city respects the well-being
of the whole planet so again a city might have clean air and clean water but it's importing from the whole world and
so its ecological impacts may be falling very very far away but very heavily through mining through logging through
plastic pollution through chemical processes so how can the city take responsibility for
all the materials it's importing and massively reduce that impact and of course a circular economy that reuses
materials is going to be a very important part of reducing that so a thriving a city that's home to
thriving people in a thriving place while respecting the well-being of all people and the health of the whole planet
local aspiration in the context of global responsibility we think every 21st century forward-looking city should
be asking itself these questions
that was kate ray worth explaining her framework i highly recommend reading her book
tonight economics seven ways to think like a 21st century economist and join their community at
the donut economics action lab website donuteconomics.org to be up to date with amazing work
",positive,Youtube,
204-18,"that they are doing sarah so we have anarika doma the director of global alliances and cities
at circle economy and evelyn yonkov the program manager for amsterdam circular with us
thank you so much for being with us and we're going to dive straight into how the circular economy and donut
economics are really powerful frameworks for cities and how and why amsterdam
have has implemented this framework enrique if we come to you first
um could you maybe talk to us about how the donut economics framework accelerates the transition to
a circular economy in cities yes so good afternoon thank you
so the donut economics framework provides that framework where we work towards
thriving people in a thriving place as kate just explains beautifully we
know that the circular economy contributes largely to basically meeting societal needs
within the planetary boundaries the green space of the donut itself
and to give you an example of a circular strategy in a city you could
think of local food systems local circular economy food systems
each city wants to provide its citizens with jobs with education but also
limiting the emissions related to the global supply chain it currently 
",neutral,Youtube,
204-19,"is
this is following a bit what k just explained as well and especially in the global north our
countries um and our cities where we are today are over consuming and consuming a lot
and it's all based on a lot of these global supply chains so for example the transportation
movements are huge in this sense by working towards a
circular food system in cities you're reducing the cloud the emission impact
that come with those transportation but it could also provide extra jobs locally so urban production
urban consumption and bring it all close to the city while reducing the food waste and
bringing the nutrients back to the soil close to home so i think this touches upon quite some themes that kate just
explained that the donut brings together and what does this donut economics framework
give a city that other frameworks don't i think that's a very nice
question sk just said we're working with c quite some c-40 cities and
donut economics action lab and what we have seen in this learning journey because we have
just started a year and a half ago so i'm not pretending to know but what we
",positive,Youtube,
204-20,"see is that it connects it connects the minds and hearts it connects people from different
departments within the city it connects civil society organization
businesses and the city officials through one framework it's very
intuitive and it provides a narrative that everyone can relate to so it's something that i have not seen
before when working with cities actually and andre kate i just mentioned why you why why the
donut why she started sorry working with um cities in in the global north let's say
um do you believe that that the framework could be applied to other contexts or other cities around
the world um yes we definitely believe that it's been
a large part of the discussions that we've had we have currently developed the
methodology donut economics action lab has developed a methodology we've inputted into that
and it's mainly piloted amongst cities with a similar profile
with high economic activity and also high consumption patterns so the tool
the city portrait tool that's been created is suitable for these global north cities
but i have we also recognized the fact that for example working on providing
this social foundation for many global south cities 
",positive,Youtube,
204-21,"while not they are not overshooting the planetary
boundaries today they should not be working on similar strategies to get to
this safe and just space as global north cities so yes we believe it can be applied to
different contexts and yes the methodology will have to be adapted a bit is the the donut framework
necessarily a recipe for success in a city or would you say that there are some let's say pre-existing conditions
that could that could help uh leave lead the donald framework application uh
to a great result in a city um
we believe that some of the guiding principles but again we're learning so i also want to
answer this question uh in a humble way um we believe that this happens through participatory
processes of working with civil society organizations of working with businesses
but also with the city itself and it's a collaborative process it also
has to be very transparent and open and everybody will have to change the mindset
and the mind shift that's needed to get from a linear to a circular economy
which is a necessity to get to that safe and just space so there are 
",neutral,Youtube,
204-22,"some guiding principles
but i'm not i think we're learning uh a lot and we'll probably have more
guiding principles or at least experiences to share in a short time
or along the road we've um through some conversations with
you we've understood that um there have been some unexpected results from applying the donor economics framework
within amsterdam one of which has been the development of a coalition a donut economics coalition
in amsterdam which some other cities are interested in could you talk to us a little bit about the role of
circle economy in expanding the framework and its application globally and maybe a little bit about
these coalitions that that are wanting to be developed around the world
um i'll answer the question about the donut coalitions uh first so the donut coalitions that we
see our bottom up um our bottom up activities and and have
actually been ignited by civil society organizations and a coalition of
a lot of people that see the donut as a framework that they can work with for a better city for a thriving city a
thriving place and um i think what we've seen in amsterdam that happened 
",positive,Youtube,
204-23,"at this
in simultaneously while we were working with the donut uh based on the donut model with the
city itself but evelyn will talk about that later um we also saw that the donut coalition
of educational institutes of other civil society organizations and a large set of businesses started
and what we're currently doing is bringing these together to accelerate all the great initiatives and you could
see on the website of a donut coalition amsterdam for example how many donut deals
as they call them citizen citizen initiatives based on the donuts there
are so many of them but also in melbourne we see a similar donut collective arising which
is very very inspiring actually and it's really a bottom-up movement um if i can say uh to your second
question of the role of circle economy our role is to down scale it in a practical way
to the city level we're creating the participatory processes um and co-creative processes and
obviously bring out also together with you the circular
economy expertise to these cities and the yeah the fundamental need of a system
a systemic change which is needed so thanks so much enrique before 
",positive,Youtube,
204-24,"we talk to
evelyn in amsterdam we're going to watch a short clip about donut economics
framework being applied to the city our aim is for amsterdam to be a thriving city where everyone can prosper
while maintaining respect for the earth and its planetary boundaries our current way of life affects people
and places all over the world our level of consumption is depleting raw materials
and causing significant co2 emissions elsewhere to change this we need to rethink the
way we produce and consume in other words amsterdam needs to become a circular city
but how first we examine the impact our actions have on other parts of the world
and documented this in the amsterdam city donut based on kate rayworth's donut model
second we created a circular strategy with concrete actions regarding food buildings and goods activities that not
only reduce our own consumption and prevent waste but also set an example for residents
and businesses like the vondeltown the circular district back slaughterhound or our port serving as a circular hub
however amsterdam needs to do this as a whole together with residents and business
we are developing solutions both big and small many initiatives 
",positive,Youtube,
204-25,"are already underway
which we support with coaching funding and sometimes as a launching customer
the kovid 19 crisis hit our society and economy hard it's important that we recover from it
in a way that benefits everyone we need to stimulate the economy in a circular way
for our prosperity and our future amsterdam circular city in 2050
so we've heard from anarika the advantages of using the donut economics framework at the city level
so it's great to have someone from the city of amsterdam with us to talk to us a little bit more about
really kind of how this this framework applies more at a granular level um to a city so we know that amsterdam
has developed one circular economy roadmap and this year you released your second roadmap
and as part of that roadmap development you use the donut economics framework to be able to develop that
evelyn could you talk to us about why you decided to use this model as opposed to the model that you used
before or other models that exist yes happy to do so
",neutral,Youtube,
204-26,"good afternoon to you all um what we did when we developed the first roadmap it
was based on a research say journey to find out where we have to
focus on and we decided back then a couple of years ago to focus on the build environment value chain and
the food and biomass value chain we evaluated all those projects that we realized
in the last couple of years and we concluded that we can't afford as a city to only look
at say the physical environment or the environmental boundaries we also have to take into account
the social foundation and when we met anderica again and also together with
kate we decided very quickly and that uh the next step in the
development of our new strategy and to really become a climate neutral and inclusive
and circular city um that it is a unique opportunity to use the donuts
economics framework as an underlying methodology or starting point or framework
on which we can build our new strategy so what we did by developing the new
five-year strategy and also the two-year innovation and an action program is that we checked
",positive,Youtube,
204-27,"very thoroughly if every aspect every building stone of the strategy and this
program is really helping us to stay within the planetary boundaries and at the same
time strengthen social foundation and in your new roadmap you focused on
three sectors um so you have the built environment and organic and and the food organic
waste streams in the food sector and you've added consumer products as a focus area for amsterdam
could you talk us through about what the donut economics framework looks like when applied to a specific
sector like consumer goods or the built environment
yeah what you did because we we're looking at these three value chains and when we also developed together the
strategy and all the the two and more hundreds of
projects within the innovation and action program we did that together with all the
different departments we have in our city administration so it's really a city-wide program and
we also include other stakeholders like the businesses the citizens the knowledge
institutions so it's a kind of movement that we are creating throughout our city
um and using the learned economic frameworks makes us realize that when we are developing our
",neutral,Youtube,
204-28,"projects like looking at a food and an organic waste stream value chain that also given the actual
situation of the pandemic a new project like farmers to neighbors
is about shorten the food chain and at the same time making sure that all people in amsterdam are provided
with healthy and sustainable food so that is really applying the donut on
a very concrete project another one is also during the the
present pandemic is a project called everybody connected in which we are
helping all those households and also especially the children or
have to stay at home and at the same time needs education to apply them with refurbished laptops
so also again using existing material and existing laptops refurbish them
and share them with those who can't afford to buy a new laptop by themselves it's also i think very practical example
of how we apply the donut on the level of the city and from another perspective when we
look at say the the build environment because laptops is an example of of course of the consumer goods value
chain when we look at the build environment an example 
",positive,Youtube,
204-29,"is that when we look at city district development
there are a lot of values already captured on the level of the city district by look at energy sources
water supply biodiversity social cohesion existing materials because there are
existing buildings and what we do is we start to look at these city districts
by looking at all those different values so we make a value inventory and then based on that
inventory we can decide what values we have to to keep when we are
renovating the city district or redeveloping the city district so of all levels of our city throughout all those
value chains we can apply all those different aspects of the city donuts and it means
also that when we look at a project or where we look at the decision we have to
make as a city we can make a balanced decision because we look at all those different
aspects together before i let laura ask a question because i know she has
she definitely has questions for you as well you mentioned that you've translated circular economy from
a program to a movement in amsterdam something that i know you're very proud 
",neutral,Youtube,
204-30,"of and that's something that many cities
that we speak to are striving for as well could you maybe quickly just tell us a
little bit about how you've managed to do that yes what we did we started the
development of this new strategy at the beginning of last year in 2019 in the spring of 2019 and we invited
colleagues from all different departments to work together with us with kate and with enrique and her team on the
building blocks for this new strategy so we involved from the start start all
those different colleagues and all those different perspectives um we did the same in october 2019
with even more colleagues to actually build a new strategy and we ask them okay please show me your
projects and make and let's combine all those projects
within one common uh commonly shared uh innovation and action program
and beginning of this year in january we invited hundreds of representatives of
businesses stakeholders ngos and citizens to comment on the draft version of both
the strategy and the program so it's really a shared vision a shared program and a
shared strategy and we combine this also with 
",neutral,Youtube,
204-31,"the development of a monitoring
framework to actually monitoring the progress uh towards a circular climate neutral and inclusive
city and uh and and also capable of speaking about that
we actually developed the first city portrait to see on both the local and the global
level looking at it from the societal and ecological perspective where we stand as a city and all those
four elements are so important to create this movement to build this movement and to maintain this
movement and strengthen it brilliant um evelyn there are two things that
clearly stand out for me from what you are saying first is the degree of collaboration
that you need within the city which is at least in my opinion pretty outstanding of all
the work that you are doing in amsterdam and then the second thing is that through the four lenses that kate
mentioned the three value chains that you've just explained to us you've probably you probably had to had
to deal with a lot of data both qualitative and quantitative um so in your opinion what are the main
learning and outcomes of having used the donut framework
",positive,Youtube,
204-32,"well what we see of course it's it's at this stage of transition we all know that's very hard to collect
all the data because we have so many data owners in our society so what we are now doing is actually
develop so-called innovative data partnerships with owners
of data like the port of amsterdam or the airport or businesses or national
research institutes so that's how can we develop new kinds of partnerships around
data which i think it's it's great learning and also when you look at a city portrait
and see the impact we have on both the global and the local level
from these different various different lenses you see that it is
extremely important and crucial that we balance our decisions and that we
use this integrated thinking as a starting point for making decisions that
means also that we have to work throughout the city administration
as one organization and that's what we're actually doing
in this strategy and in the program is working together as one organization based on this
say fundamental thinking around donut economics and also when we look at
the the present crisis it's even more obvious that we 
",negative,Youtube,
204-33,"have to change the way we work
and live and develop our cities and when you mention data partnerships is that how you are
planning to measure pre progress uh towards the donut and if you and if i may ask
how is amsterdam currently doing according to to the data
well we are now building our first monitoring framework uh we hope to share it with
the rest of the world the first version of it in spring next year um and because we need a lot of data
but what we saw and that strikes us even more we already know that
we need a circle economy in order to reach the various agreements what we did when we look at the first
minute monitoring framework we calculated the amount of materials we used in one year
and then we calculated the related amount of co2 emissions caused elsewhere in the world and what
you see is on the level of a city a one-third of the total amount of co2 we produce
as a city not only amsterdam at all cities are related to the use of electricity
and heat and transportation two-thirds of the  co2 emissions
",positive,Youtube,
204-34,"
we cause as a city is produced elsewhere is related to the way we could produce
and consume that's striking and so we need to change the present economic
system also in order to reach the paris agreement so that was one also of the striking findings
of this first monitoring framework thank you so much evelyn thank you
enrique and thanks sarah for co-hosting this this session with me here thank you at
home for watching us we hope that you have enjoyed it as much as we have and we look forward to
seeing um how the framework gets applied in other places and how amsterdam continues to work towards

Circular economy is about increasing resource efficiency, while Jevon's paradox says increased efficiency increases the rate of consumption.

This is important for a steady state economy: A kind of economy which assumes a constant stock of resources and a constant population size.

The real issue is whole cost pricing and the struggle to nail down how much something actually is ""worth"" according not just to market demand but also from a labor and environmental perspective. To wit: goods that pollute and produce net poverty in their country of manufacture have higher longterm net costs. But the up-front price tag is lower to manufacturers (and, at the end of the day, consumers).

So, in theory, the solution is whole-cost pricing that takes into account all factors.

Standard linear economy looks something like this:

Disposal (End point)

It creates a straight line from manufacturing, retail, and then disposal when the object breaks or is obsolete. Most of the time it's how we function now.

The transition to a circular economy is essential in achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

Initiatives range from reusing materials and design for deconstruction to efforts to establish marketplaces for used building materials. However, in order to transition to a fully circular construction industry, reuse of materials from the built environment should increase. In order to do so, materials passports can be of use as they provide materials with a documented identity and value to enable them to remain visible in the economy. Knowledge of what is stored in the built environment stimulates reuse of products, prevents destruction of materials, and makes it easier to eliminate waste. Wide application of materials passports can steer the outlook towards valuing the existing built environment as a potential materials depot for future buildings.",neutral,Blog,

Mainly the larger construction companies are increasingly focusing on innovation and digitalization of their business models. In this area, building information modeling (BIM) serves as a main enabler. At an increasing pace, BIM models are used from the initiation phase to serve as a platform on which multiple stakeholders collaborate. Subsequently, the move towards digital twins allows failure costs to be reduced and more efficient work processes to be created. Digital twins are a real-time digital representation of a physical object that continuously delivers information on the assets’ properties and statuses. These developments align well with the function of materials passports. IT platforms such as Madaster use BIM models to create materials passports of buildings. Once the passport is available, project developers can decide on more circular materials use in the design phase of the building, increasing circularity and, ideally, financial residual

Advanced construction methods incorporate these new materials while reducing overall material consumption and increasing reuse.

Another research effort has proposed the use of a renewable wood-based thermal energy storage composite, combined with biodegradable phase-change materials. This project is advancing the use of thermal energy storage in buildings, which has shown great promise for reducing energy consumption and shifting loads.

Keeping upfront costs low is still an issue in construction, which may negate any future value and it has been highlighted that the initial investor may not benefit directly, as the benefits may fall to the final owner (Zuidema, 2015).

CDW materials can be a key driver of this transformation as most of them can be reused or recycled [8].

For instance, waste prevention strategies are more likely to take effect at the designing phase while most untreated CDW has to be recycled or backfilled at the EoL phase. Thus, it is imperative to admit that there is no one-fits-all recipe for CE.

ST is a holistic method focused on the establishment and dynamic interrelationship of constituent parts of a system to address the inherent complexity [32]. SD is a methodology based on ST that addresses process complexity using simulation techniques [33,34]. The results of this study will help CI practitioners implement the CE in a way that drives innovation, boosts economic growth, and improves competitiveness. By implementing CE principles in CI, industry costs would be lowered, negative environmental impacts reduced, inherent complexities tackled, and resilience of urban areas enhanced to make them more livable, productive, and convenient.",positive,Article,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/12/7/1013

10-2,"The concept of CE is a sustainable development strategy, which through a regenerative model, improves the efficiency of materials and energy use and reduces waste and emissions [10]. The concept of CE has deep-rooted origins, and it is not easy to recognise a specific date or a single author [11,12,13,14,15]. Nevertheless, some practical examples applied to economic systems and industrial processes have been implemented during the late 1970s, led by a small number of academics, intellectual leaders and businesses. With the CE comes a paradigm shift from the existing linear economy model of “take-make-consume-dispose” to a more sustainable model of “take-make-consume-reuse-recycle” [16]. The circular economy is based on the three following fundamental principles, each of which addresses several of the resource and system challenges facing industrial economies [17,18,19]:
1: Conserve and increase the natural capital by saving finite resources and stabilising renewable resources’ fluxes.
2: Optimise resources efficiency always, furnishing materials, components and products at their maximum value and performance levels, in both technical and biological cycles.
3: Promote system efficiency by identifying and eliminating negative externalities from the design.",neutral,Article,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/16/9416

11-1,"Due to resources consumption and associated environmental concern, the adoption of circular economy (CE) principles into the building industry has emerged recently. CE is deeply rooted within industrial ecology, often considered as branch of industrial ecology, became more and more important due to the latest environmental-socio-political agenda [27]. CE and sustainability, the interconnected concepts, are gaining popularity among the policymakers, academia and industry [28]. The key aims of CE in the building are: (i) to improve materials efficiency and optimize energy use by considering the sustainability of materials sourcing through integrating collaboration advantages between industries [29,30], (ii) to promote the maximum reusing of materials and to minimize waste generation [31], (iii) to avoid waste generation to landfill [32], (iv) to optimize economic development with the resources use and environmental impacts [33,34,35]. Thus, CE provides an opportunity to reduce the use of natural materials, conserving resources and reducing the carbon footprint [34] and reducing the risk of material supply and price volatility [35].",positive,Article,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/3/1310
11-2,"To ensure effective CE adoption, the performance evaluation including the quantification of building materials and components including their circularity at the early design stage is needed. Thus, based on the early stage of design, BIM can help identify material flows at different stages including the end-of-life of buildings [29], where LCA can be used to evaluate the environmental performance by included all processes from the cradle-to-cradle system boundary [31,36,37], for adopting the CE principle. Although several studies have focused on BIM integrated LCA for buildings, how to use the BIM–LCA platform effectively to enhance the building sustainability driven by CE is still a research question. By reviewing and analyzing the existing literature comprehensively, this paper aimed to explore the key drivers including the challenges and opportunities for adopting BIM integrated LCA in designing sustainable buildings, and the way of CE promotion in such integrated design by highlighting the drawbacks with potential solutions and prospective integrative framework for sustainable buildings construction.",neutal,Article,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/3/1310

11-6,"The main goal of CE is to limit new material extraction while retaining the economics of the extracted materials for a long time to reduce the residual waste. This is extremely important for the building industry, which consumes a huge number of natural resources globally and generates a considerable volume of waste annually. For achieving long run sustainability, the use of the CE concepts may be the key strategy for in-depth assessment, as it already includes environmental, social, economic, business and policy aspects into the CE framework [70,71]. According to the UK Green Building Council, about 50% of greenhouse gas emission was contributed by the construction industry in the country [72], and about 40% of waste generation was by the industry in the EU. Thus, the EU regards the CE package as one of the five priority industries in the construction industry [73].",neutral,Article,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/3/1310
11-7,"However, the implementation of CE into the buildings is not straight forward, as buildings are unique entities and are often the results of one-off projects. Since each component used has a natural life cycle and all of them are connected in space and time, this feature increases its natural complexity. Furthermore, their service life and renovation during use phase will make an increasing uncertainty in future alternatives. [71]. End-of-life activities such as demolition are responsible for more than 50% of the entire waste generated by the construction industry. The design of material circularity is challenging issue. Thus, new technologies and design approaches are required with a view of the challenge of materials circularity for adopting CE approach, particularly from the traditional ‘take-make-dispose’ system to a circular perspective on material reuse.",negative,Article,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/3/1310
